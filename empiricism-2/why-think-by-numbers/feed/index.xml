		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Michael!

Yes. I loved Cognitive Surplus.

I love your painting, too!  I&#039;d love to buy you a real dinner.  Where do you live? I&#039;d also be happy to give  100% of my net income from the website as well.  (I think that comes out to around negative $200.)

Did you notices that I already had it linked to this site http://fineartamerica.com/featured/triune-brain-michael-stancato.html which says it only costs $2500. 


I&#039;ll change it to your other site, though. Let me know if you&#039;d ever like me to switch it to anything else or if you don&#039;t want me to use it anymore. 


It&#039;s really brilliant. I appreciate your generosity in not taking me to Judge Judy! :D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Mike,

I like what you&#039;re promoting and will visit your site to learn more. Have you seen Clay Shirky&#039;s idea which is similar to yours? 

http://www.ted.com/talks/clay_shirky_how_the_internet_will_one_day_transform_government?language=en

Maybe you can join forces.

I&#039;m the artist for the Triune Brain painting. Wanna buy me a nice dinner... virtually... for the use of the painting? If not feel free to continue using it. I&#039;ll chalk it up learning about marking my art for copyrighting etc.... At $75/hour it&#039;s probably a $3000 painting. 

Can you add a link to my site www.motionista.com or the link to the painting on my blog:
http://motionista.blogspot.com/2011/08/august-painting-and-drawing.html

Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When I originally commented I clicked the &quot;Notify me when new comments are added&quot; checkbox and now each time a comment 
is added I get several e-mails with the same comment.
Is there any way you can remove me from that service?
Appreciate it!

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Mighty Bob,
I just listened to this podcast, which I found via the Stitcher radio app. I hope Stitcher broadens your listener base, because your message is so needed plus you are damn funny, articulate and informative. Bravo. I look forward to more enjoyment and rational persuasion as I keep listening.
