		<description><![CDATA[There are a number of good reasons for significant spending to prevent terror which this article fails to cover.
A powerful one is the dirty bomb argument. Perhaps 150 years ago, when terrorists could only kill with clubs and knives and perhaps inefficient guns, you may have had a point. In those days one terrorist might have killed a few people in a single frenzied attack. These days, terrorists have shown that they can kill hundreds or thousands in a single event involving a handful of terrorists. As dirty bomb technology becomes more available to terrorists the number that a single terrorist can kill will reach the tens of thousands and more and the related economic damage will dwarf that of 911. If you think this is scare mongering read this : https://www.foreignaffairs..../

		<description><![CDATA[Fallacious argument.  You could apply the same false argument to military spending in general:  Almost zero deaths from Russians or Communist China during Cold War means we should ever have spent money on the Military.  Even the Japanese only killed 2400, why spend money and declare war when more Americans died from car accidents in that same year?

You never ask the question about how much death, injury, economic instability, etc. is prevented through investments in counter-terrorism.  Instead you snobbishly discount the whole affair as the result of stupid humans overreacting, while idiotically overlooking the obvious reason.

You, like all weak minded conspiratorial leftists fail to understand the threat?  How much damage would have been done if a 2004 dirty bomb plot was not foiled at the NYC stock exchange?  What would have been the damage in human lives and economic impact of the foiled plot to blow up a natural gas refinery in 2005?  These are just a couple of the scores of potentially world changing attacks that have been prevented.

Maybe you should stop trying to think by numbers and start thinking with reason instead, fool.

Reading through all the comments it&#039;s sad how many fell for your rhetoric.  Pathetic sheep one and all.]]></description>

I asked why are the taxpayers pay for &quot;temporary employees?&quot;  Hiring a temporary employee is a &quot;tax write off and expense.&quot;  Frankly, I don&#039;t understand why the taxpayers are paying for free labor to successful companies!!!!!  It STINKS OF CORRUPTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!]]></description>
