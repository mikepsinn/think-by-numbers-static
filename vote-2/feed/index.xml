		<description><![CDATA[Wishes to Providence&#039;s Current Day Irrationally Virtuous Butterflies, who&#039;s innate drives toward a more perfect community of man has manifested in this wonderfully irrational website fluttering, are as follows

Providing measures of relevance to place these numbers in perspective such as following examples:  

Dollar amounts per American Citizen (per tax payer, per family of four; % of median and Mean incomes; % total 1% income ECT. ECT.) for examples: food stamps cost per Citizen by my rough calculation is $18+&#124;- billion dollars per year divided 333 +&#124;- citizens equals $54 dollars per year, per citizen; life time median &#038; mean --&#062; life time benefits per individual, months used, months on food stamps.  (Dollar amount per 20 percentiles lowest to highest).  ECT ECT ECT with related references.
     These type of relevant measures put reality in of these cost in perspective and by providing references individuals and individual reporters can place our counties choices in perspective.  
       Intra budget percentages, such as comparing food stamps cost as a percentage  of the cost of the  cost of Iraq War, Farm Subsidies (especially large farmers, large corporate farms, congressional and senate members &#038; their families farms; military spending the military itself does not want; ) ECT ECT ECT 
       Contribution to budget deficits over time such as following: Iraq War due to compounding interest over the next 10 &#038; 20 &#038; 30 ...... years; drug war inflation cumulative contribution with compounding interest over the commingle decades.  
       Consider also, quantifying the opportunity cost of drug war related - both direct, indirect such as following: lost productivity toward other goods and services related to the incarcerated, the guards, drug war related morbidity and mortality (&#038; related lost income for both m &#038; m, cost of treatment), cost to countries around the world)
         For example, via an albeit rough estimate, if we had never waged a war on drugs, It is likely, we would not currently would not have a government deficit.  That is, if you consider all the related cost, only some of which are noted noted above, that is if you could apply all these cost -- especially opportunity cost, it&#039;s direct cost, cost of money, and the incalculable cost of lost talent/creativity/genius and also, severe/wide spread pain and suffering.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, any one individuals political efforts such as voting, contributing money/time/effort toward a politician and/or political party with a goal toward representing one&#039;s values, for most people will not directly and/or indirectly likely to change the out come in the short and/or long run.  By that reasoning, it is probable that any one person putting their time/money/efforts is similarly will not likely change any major change.  Similarly, The individuals during the America&#039;s Revolt against were also behaving irrationally for their own lives and even for their children&#039;s lives; nevertheless, let us thank providence that their emotions and related values drove them forward to achieve to the birth of America and it&#039;s long history of many irrational actors ultimately moving America toward a relatively more perfect union and relatively more positive influence on the world, over time.  So, I encourage irrationally encourage and praise your efforts to move our political/social efforts to make the world a better place.  Remember, ultimately, over time, drops of water ultimately wear down mountains.  Also, consider no one butterfly knows that its fluttering wings, to full fill its drive to survive, will result in the butterfly effect.  Thank good for the emotional and irrational drive toward freedom, justice, and a more perfect union of butterflys such as our founding fathers and patriots who placed at risk and many who lost their lives and fortunes.

Blessings of Providence&#039;s Irrationally Virtuous Butterflies

		<description><![CDATA[Sure, it&#039;s the statement(s), &quot;The people reading this are individuals not collective society.  These individuals do not have control over collective society.  They only have control of their own actions.&quot;

My point was that individuals are necessarily part of collective society because collective society is necessarily comprised of individuals. Individuals of no effect on collective society may exist in theory, but in reality they are always a part of that society and the acts of those individuals necessarily have some effect on collective society.  Even though the effect one individual&#039;s vote has is marginal, it still is an effect.  Virtually no effect is not the same as no effect at all.  There&#039;s still something there.  Accordingly, if I am an individual who comprises a necessary part of a collective society whose vote has a marginal effect on society, then it follows that while I cannot control the actions of collective society outright I can at least have some effect on it.]]></description>
