		<description><![CDATA[I have one.  I&#039;ve sent a letter to Dems, Republicans and even Obama when he was in office and the ONLY PERSON to answer me back was Bernie Sanders.  I asked why are the taxpayers pay for &quot;temporary employees?&quot;  Hiring a temporary employee is a &quot;tax write off and expense.&quot;  Frankly, I don&#039;t understand why the taxpayers are paying for free labor to successful companies!!!!!  It STINKS OF CORRUPTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Rachael!  Actually, 50% more doesn&#039;t mean 50% of $92 in this context.  50% more means 50% of $59 billion + $59 billion. ($92 - $59)/$59 = 55% more spent on corporate welfare. I just rounded to 50%.  :D]]></description>
