I&#039;m not sure about Google&#039;s algorithms.  Somehow, I got to 2nd place for &quot;welfare statistics&quot;.  I have no idea why, though.  


I can see both sides of the argument on social welfare programs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike, have you noticed that Cato, Heritage and half a hundred other rightie websites engaged in fighting the War against Welfare have all but taken over Google&#039;s response to requests for info on &quot;us welfare statistics by state&quot; or even &quot;us welfare statistics&quot;? And they must be paying a tidy sum, as Cato&#039;s pdf assault leads off an amazing number of Googlepages. After quite a while &#038; quite an effort, I finally got to you and a few more people &#038; articles on the other side, but I did get here. The big trick in Cato&#039;s pdf is its proclamation that the U.S. is &quot;losing&quot; LBJ&#039;s War on Poverty at a trillion a year. I&#039;d like to explain to Cato that the trillion is for helping the poor, but they&#039;d never hear me. And LBJ&#039;s old line from a liberal&#039;s heart has been captured &#038; carted away.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[hm, good article, but i would be hesitant to blame it completely on the feds.. there is just no sustainable way for investors to continually expect returns on investment that outpace inflation. in fact, inflation caused by the fed is one of the biggest things fighting this trend..

as a result, any capitalist system in late stages will become overwhelmed with an inefficient finance industry. they suck all the money out of the system, then sit on it, sucking any productivity dry that might arise.. 

laissez faire = lazy fair]]></description>
