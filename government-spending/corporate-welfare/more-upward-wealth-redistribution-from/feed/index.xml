		<description><![CDATA[My college professor explained this scenario back in 2002, he said they &quot;your so-called government&quot; wants to keep track of you, and have each citizen health records in their central database.  And when they decide you are not profitable for their benefit anymore (because you do know you work for &quot;your&quot; government) then they will decide to euthanize you.  Look it up. What if they force u to sign the euthanasia papers by force....u know how many &quot;Americans&quot; this could affect.  U have to always think deep at the broader picture.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;FIrst, the amount available to docs is more.&quot;  

How much more?  What are your sources?  I&#039;ve hyperlinked all mine.

&quot;Second, it&#039;s not to use an iPad, it&#039;s the total credit available for all investment in electronic health records - that&#039;s a national goal that&#039;s been in place for over 15 years - it&#039;s designed to improve patient care and efficiency across the board for all healthcare providers.&quot;

All you have to do is use that ipad app to qualify. I&#039;ve linked to the source on that. Please link to a source that indicates otherwise.

&quot;Qualified institutions and providers can take the credit only against their actual expenses - no different than any other tax credit.&quot;

OK. Where do I claim otherwise?  A tax credit looks the same as a subsidy in the recipients bank account and in the treasury.

&quot;The credit only goes against actual investment - so your claim is lame.&quot;  

What does this mean?  Where is your source?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But why wouldn&#039;t they just do this on their own if it saves money?  Why do middle class people have to get money taken out of their paychecks to pay for this?  Wouldn&#039;t the savings for patients be cancelled out by their increased tax rates?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would be intrigued to see the numbers saved over time of this switch to electronic record keeping.  Will there be better healthcare.  Whats the number of patients a doctor can see in a day using and Ipad compared to having to view a paper file. What is the time saving factor of electronically sending my perscription instead of my doctor having to stop, go back to his desk and write out my perscription.  There eventually will be a trickle down savings to the patients.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[$44K over 5 years to adopt expensive electronic billing that will (we hope) prevent and catch FRAUD seems reasonable.  If it makes doctors and their offices more efficient then we might get better healthcare outcomes.  That (again we hope) means fewer ER visits for health problems that should have been &quot;fixed&quot; and not gotten to crisis ER point.]]></description>
