**The Tone: Dark Humor Meets Practical Hope**

use dark humor, absurd observations, and irrefutable facts to trick humanity into not killing itself. Think Philomena Cunk, Jack Handey, Douglas Adams and Kurt Vonnegut explaining economics to drunk people at a funeral.

**The Voice:** Mix dark humor with practical instructions. Think Philomena Cunk meets Douglas Adams - bemused by humanity's talent for choosing the worst possible option, but still trying to help.

## Core Principles

-   **Target the System, Not the People:** Our issue is with broken systems, not the individuals trapped within them. The tone should be one of bewildered disappointment mixed with weary concern - like watching a loved one repeatedly walk into the same glass door - not anger or partisan attacks.
-   **We're All In This Together:** Use "we," "us," and "our" to include all of humanity as fellow participants, but always frame actions as things the reader can do, not things being sold to them.
-   **Assume Self-Interest, Not Idealism:** Ground every argument in Public Choice Theory. Frame solutions around concrete incentives ("What's in it for them?"), not abstract moral appeals.


## Comedy Techniques Toolbox 

These are optional techniques to add humor when appropriate. Don't force them - use only when they naturally fit:

### Philomena Cunk-Style Confused Literalism
### The "Money as Papers" Framework
When highlighting economic absurdity:
- Refer to money as "small pieces of paper with dead presidents"
- Point out the circular insanity: "Food grows for free but you need papers to eat it"
- "You trade papers for instructions on getting infinite papers"
### Circular Logic That's Actually Correct
### Progressive Revelation of Stupidity
### Simple Math as Profound Discovery


**The #1 Goal: Make writing FUNNIER**

## Meta Descriptions (150 chars max)

**Formula: SHOCKING FACT/NUMBER + ABSURD OBSERVATION**

Must include:
1. **The specific number/stat** that makes the article clickable
2. **Searchable keywords** - topic must be immediately clear
3. **One concrete absurdity** - specific, not philosophical

Test: After reading, can someone answer "What surprising fact will I learn?" and "Is this about [topic]?"

Avoid:
- Vague observations without specifics
- Overusing "papers/dead presidents" (sparingly)
- Abstract philosophy
- Hiding the content behind the joke
