		<description><![CDATA[thanks Mike for the blog. i&#039;d like to see you and the others who post here conduct a presidential debate with our current choices based on the numbers to confront the rhetoric. 

You can always separate the truth from the fiction with numbers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1. Alan Greenspan, suck-up to Ayn Rand, caused the the crisis more than any other single person. His quotes about there NOT being a housing bubble make great reading.

2. A. Colin Flood is correct. Derivatives were the single biggest cause of the crisis--and remain basically unregulated.

So, we are headed for yet another crisis.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not claiming a correlation between money supply and financial crises.  I&#039;m illustrating a correlation between Household Debt to GDP ratio and financial crises.  

Do you see any specific sentences with factual inaccuracies that I should change?

My problem with quantitative easing is that it&#039;s functionally a flat inflationary tax imposed on all of society (even the poor) which is predominantly funneled from productive sectors of the economy to the relatively unproductive financial sector.

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you!  Very informative!

Didn&#039;t the Fed&#039;s artificially low interest rates fuel the Swap Bubble by encouraging borrowing and making mortgage securities a more attractive investment relative to treasury bonds?

Didn&#039;t the Fed&#039;s low reserve requirements help inflate the bubble?

Didn&#039;t the implicit guarantee of a bailout by the Fed (i.e. Privatized gains, socialized losses) incentive institutions to make risky loans?]]></description>
