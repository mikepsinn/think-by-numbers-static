				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The cause of the US financial crisis is simple. It&#8217;s debt. This is a very simple and graphical evidence-based explanation of what caused the collapse.</p>
<p>The massive increase in the level of consumer debt prior to the recent financial crisis bears a striking resemblance to another period in economic history.  That other period of unprecedented borrowing occurred just before 1929.  Twin Peaks didn&#8217;t make it very clear who killed Laura Palmer, but they make it pretty obvious who killed the US economy. The murderer is debt.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/Twin-Peaks-of-Household-Debt-to-GDP-Ratio.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="762" data-permalink="/debt/household-debt-to-gdp-ratio-100/attachment/twin-peaks-of-household-debt-to-gdp-ratio/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/Twin-Peaks-of-Household-Debt-to-GDP-Ratio.jpg?fit=960%2C320&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="960,320" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Historical-Household-Debt-to-GDP-Ratio" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/Twin-Peaks-of-Household-Debt-to-GDP-Ratio.jpg?fit=300%2C100&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/Twin-Peaks-of-Household-Debt-to-GDP-Ratio.jpg?fit=960%2C320&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-762" title="Twin Peaks of Debt: Historical Household Debt to GDP Ratio" src="https://i2.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/Twin-Peaks-of-Household-Debt-to-GDP-Ratio.jpg?resize=605%2C202" alt="Graph of US Historical Household Debt to GDP Ratio" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/Twin-Peaks-of-Household-Debt-to-GDP-Ratio.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i2.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/Twin-Peaks-of-Household-Debt-to-GDP-Ratio.jpg?resize=300%2C100&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/Twin-Peaks-of-Household-Debt-to-GDP-Ratio.jpg?resize=768%2C256&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/Twin-Peaks-of-Household-Debt-to-GDP-Ratio.jpg?resize=672%2C224&amp;ssl=1 672w" sizes="(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">The Household Debt to GDP Ratio reached <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2009/02/household_debt_vs_gdp.html">100%</a> in 2007.  That means the average family owed as much on their mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards as they earn in a year. For a most of the 20th century, this ratio&#8217;s been under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_public_debt">50%</a>. The last time it reached 100% was 1929. Note the twin peaks in the graph.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In both crashes, the primary reason for the increase in debt is the Federal Reserve&#8217;s artificial lower of interest rates.  Initially, the lower rates cause people to borrow more to buy more.  This behavior serves as a signal to business that they should hire more people and expand their production capacity by building more factories and stuff.  This leads to short-term economic growth known as the &#8220;Boom&#8221;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This Boom period is analogous to the first few weeks of a heroin addiction.  We&#8217;ve all been there.  Ben Bernanke hooks you up with some killer junk for the first time.  You slide in the needle an pretty soon you&#8217;re a quivering mound of oozing pleasure.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Those were some crazy times.  Anyway, the Fed&#8217;s artificially low interest rates lead to over-borrowing.   Eventually, people borrow so much that they can&#8217;t take on any more debt so all this buying suddenly stops. Additionally, many people declare bankruptcy when they find they can&#8217;t make their payments.  According to the graph, this &#8220;Bust&#8221; period typically initiates when the average household debt to GDP ratio reaches 100%.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When the buying slows down, businesses don&#8217;t need so many employees anymore.  This leads to layoffs and more bankruptcies.  All this new unemployment leads to even lower consumer spending. Lower consumer spending leads to even more layoffs and bankruptcies.  Hence, the cycle just feeds on itself.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This suggests that our current crisis is about something much <strong>simpler</strong> than credit default swaps, derivatives, or toxic assets. It&#8217;s all about borrowing more than we can pay back.   This is the view of the Austrian economists who accurately predicted the impending disaster.  If the government would just let the market set the interest rate you wouldn&#8217;t have this unsustainable accumulation of debt and the inevitable resulting crash.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The only problem with that solution it that it makes sense.  Hence, it&#8217;s not really a feasible public policy option.  Naturally, the government&#8217;s solution was to do even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing" target="_blank">more </a>of what caused the problem in the first place.</p>
<p dir="ltr">President Obama reappointed Ben Bernanke, the person who&#8217;s policies helped created the initial bubble. The Federal Reserve created trillions of more dollars in new loans in order to stimulate even more borrowing and debt.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;"><em>Graph Source: <a href="https://research.stlouisfed.org/" target="_blank">http://research.stlouisfed.org/</a></em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Why would the government behave so irrationally? The reason is that the majority of people with enough expertise and money to influence the system profit from the status quo. Financial institutions like Goldman-Sachs make trillions of dollars in interest by loaning the money the Fed creates.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It works like this:</p>
<p dir="ltr">During the financial crisis, the Fed routinely made billions of dollars in &#8220;emergency&#8221; loans to big banks at near-zero interest. Many of the banks then turned around and used the money to buy Treasury bonds at higher interest rates — <strong>essentially loaning the money back to the government at an inflated rate.</strong>&#8220;People talk about how these were loans that were paid back,&#8221; says a congressional aide who has studied the transactions. &#8220;But when the state is lending money at zero percent and the banks are turning around and lending that money back to the state at three percent, <strong>how is that different from just handing rich people money?&#8221;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">To make even more money they loan it to consumers at an even higher rate in the form of mortgages, credit card loans or other forms of lending.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That is why the country&#8217;s wealth is continuously being transferred to the relatively non-productive financial sector.  The purpose of the banks is basically to facilitate the loaning of money from savers to borrowers and collect interest from the borrower.  Most of this amounts to a financial executive sitting at the top of a skyscraper moving numbers from one account to another with a computer.  Yet for this simple task many of these financial executives are paid hundreds of times more than the construction worker who built the skyscraper gets paid.</p>

<p>The US spends more than $500 million per victim on anti-terrorism efforts. &nbsp;However, cancer research spending is only $10,000 per victim. &nbsp;Evolutionary psychology may offer an explanation for this irrational threat amplification.</p>
<h6>But first a message from NATIONAL REPUBLICAN campaign committee:</h6>
<p><em>Lightning.</em></p>
<p><em>Over the last decade it has stricken more Americans than terrorists have. It will stop at nothing to destroy our way of life.</em></p>
<p><em>Yet some politicians in Washington don’t see lightning as a threat.&nbsp;Barack&nbsp;Hussein Obama&nbsp;<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">doesn</span>’t. In the Senate, he voted to allocate hundreds of billions of dollars to the so-called war on terror, while spending absolutely nothing on a threat which has taken far more American lives. He just <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">doesn</span>’t get it.</em></p>
<p><em>Barack Obama.</em></p>
<p><em>Wrong on lightning.</em></p>
<p><em>Wrong for America.</em></p>
<h3>Putting Terrorism in Perspective</h3>
<p>Roughly <a href="http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/crt/2003/33777.htm">3,000 Americans</a> have lost their lives to terrorist attacks in the last decade. This averages out to a loss of 300 people a year, which is a tragic figure and, as a country, it behooves us to do everything we can to reduce or eliminate the threat of terrorism. But there are still a lot of other ways to wind up being the main course at a worm banquet. The gravest dangers we face include heart disease, cancer, and celebrity breakups. Unfortunately, our country doesn’t have infinite resources available to eliminate every threat. So the task falls to our government to allocate what resources we do have in a manner proportional to the magnitude of each threat. If we, as a society, want to effectively counter the dangers we face, we first have to put them in perspective.</p>
<h3>How You&#8217;re Really Going to Die</h3>
</div>
<p>Ranked by the number of victims, heart disease comes in as the number one threat. It’s responsible for <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr51/nvsr51_05.pdf">70</a><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr51/nvsr51_05.pdf">0,000 deaths</a>&nbsp;a year. This coronary malady keeps food on the tables of funeral directors nationwide. And, like a perpetual motion machine, this very food fills their arteries with cholesterol leading to even more heart attacks.</p>
<p>On to number two. Cancer kills <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr51/nvsr51_05.pdf">550,000 people a year</a>. But ironically, some futurists see it as a potential key to immortality. It removes the limit on the number of times that a cell can replicate itself. Thus, if properly harnessed, this disease could be used to defy aging by allowing eternal tissue regeneration. This would enable Joan Rivers to continue enchanting Americans with her iconic brand of celebrity commentary for generations to come.</p>
</div>
<p><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr51/nvsr51_05.pdf">Runners up for the best solution to overpopulation include strokes with 160,000 casualties a year, respiratory disease with 120,000 casualties annually, diabetes at 70,000 , pneumonia at 60,000 , Alzheimer’s disease at 50,000 , and vehicular accidents at 40,000.</a></p>
<p>As previously stated, averaged over the last decade which contained the worst terrorist attack in our nation’s history, terrorism still only killed about 300 people a year. Compare this to the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090410234302/http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov:80/resources/Ltg%20Safety-Facts.pdf">1000 people</a> who are struck by lightning every year. Hopefully, by putting storm clouds on the federal no-fly list we’ll be able to reduce this number in the future. But until then, based on current trends you’re three times more likely to be struck by lightning than to be killed in a terrorist attack.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Screwed Up Spending Priorities</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve compared the risks, let’s examine how the government chooses to allocate our limited resources to combat these threats. To the least likely means of death I’ve mentioned, terrorism, the federal government devotes about <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL33110.pdf">$150 billion annually</a>. On the other hand, to combat the most likely cause of death, heart disease, the government contributes only <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090115095455/http://www.nih.gov//news/fundingresearchareas.htm">$2 billion</a>. And just <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090115095455/http://www.nih.gov//news/fundingresearchareas.htm">$300 million</a>&nbsp;is devoted to research on the third most likely cause of death, strokes.</p>
<p>So looking at it another way, we spend $500 million for every death from terrorism and only $2,000 for every death resulting from strokes. That means we spend 250,000 times more per death on terrorism. I’m sure all of this is very flattering to Osama bin Laden, but this disparity might leave some stroke victims scratching their heads, assuming they’ve retained full motor control of their arms.</p>

<h3>Why is the government response so disproportionate to the threat?</h3>
<h6>EVOLUTION</h6>
<p>Evolutionary psychology may be able to explain this phenomenon. The human brain has been around for 200,000 years. &nbsp; More than 99% of that evolution has been characterized by starvation and general scarcity of resources typified the environment in which humans evolved. &nbsp;In this situation, violent acquisition of resources from other groups was often a necessary survival&nbsp;technique. Hence, human brains most hyper-vigilant and&nbsp;aggressive&nbsp;toward human threats (i.e. terrorists) were most likely to survive and propagate these&nbsp;characteristics.</p>
<p>On the other hand, throughout evolutionary history medical science was almost non-existent. &nbsp;Hence, there would be no survival value added by a tendency to focus on more likely health-related causes of death. We just weren&#8217;t designed for these times.</p>
<h6>Anxiety Fatigue</h6>
<p>One possible reason is anxiety fatigue. When an individual is subjected to a stimulus for an extended period of time, such as the aroma of a hospital room, the sound of a fan, or the endless nagging of the mother-in-law, their mind eventually just filters it out. Mortality risks such as heart disease and cancer extend farther back in time than even the existence of our current civilization. Our society now more or less accepts these unfortunate facts of life as another cost of doing business.Thus, they’re filtered out of our collective consciousness to some extent. On the other hand, consider the SARS virus scare a few years ago. Despite the absence of a single American fatality, the newness of this airborne illness allowed it to occupy headlines for weeks. Similarly, the Islamic terrorist menace is also a relatively new phenomenon to the US. Maybe threat fatigue for terrorism just hasn’t set in yet.</p>
<h6>Economic Consequences</h6>
<p>The economic consequences of terrorism would, at first thought, seem like a justification for the level of concern. There was a huge financial cost associated with the 9/11 attacks. Total related insurance claim payments are estimated at <a href="http://www.iii.org/page-not-found?attempt=yy_obj_data/binary/760752_1_0/September%252011%2520Anniversary.pdf">$32.5 billion</a>. However, there’s been no definitive proof that the attacks lead to a significant decline in GDP. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061105182817/http://safespaces.com/SS.Security_htm/Security_Terrorism_Cost.htm">In fact, a GDP which had been falling due to recession in the quarter prior to 9/11 actually started growing again in the quarter following 9/11.</a></p>
<p>It’s conventional wisdom that military spending is good for the economy. However, most macroeconomic models show that, in the long term, military spending diverts resources from productive uses, such as consumption and investment. This ultimately slows economic growth and reduces employment. So if one thinks they’re protecting our economy by taking trillions of dollars away from other productive uses to fight the so-called global war on terror, they should consider upgrading their abycuss to a calculator.</p>
<h6>Nuclear Bombs</h6>
<p>Another seemingly more justifiable reason for a magnified response to terrorism is the potential for a nuclear attack that could result in a far greater number of casualties than the typical terrorist attacks have to date. According to many experts on nuclear proliferation, the possibly insurmountable technical challenges of building or acquiring a thermo-nuclear weapon are enormous. <a href="http://www.iiss.org/en/about-s-us/press-s-room">Including the requirement that the weapon be portable, makes the likelihood of acquisition dramatically more remote. </a>However, there is a real threat that highly enriched uranium could be aquired from a former Soviet state and used to make a crude bomb. This is a serious risk and needs to be addressed by either securing or downgrading the 1000 tons of yellowcake remaining within Russia and her neighbors. The government currently spends about a billion dollars on this effort annually. Compare this to the two billion we spend in Iraq every week and one might assume we have a bonobo setting our national security priorities in exchange for bananas.</p>
<h6>Human Psychology</h6>
<p>Finally, the psychological makeup of our species could also be a contributing factor to this risk amplification. Just look at the plot structure of a work of fiction. The vast majority of conflicts are between a human protagonist and a human antagonist.We seem to maintain an inherent attraction to interpersonal or, on a larger scale, inter-societal conflict. It’s only natural that this affinity translates to our media diet as well. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110812194103/http://comminfo.rutgers.edu/jri/workingpapers/agendasettingsars2003.html">Many studies have shown that the media sets the public policy agenda.</a>So, the point is that interpersonal and societal conflicts like that between Western civilization and Muslim extremists are simply better able to maintain our attention than conflicts between man and complex, abstract medical threats.</p>
<p>In addition, sociologists and psychologists have determined that society amplifies the danger of risks imposed upon them, such as terrorism. Conversely, society finds risks resulting from voluntary behavior, such as car accidents, more acceptable.</p>

<h2 id="internal-source-marker_0.338832648110431" dir="ltr">Juggalo&#8217;s Corner</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>By George &#8220;Ghost F**ker&#8221; Will</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">   A plurality of Americans believe that Iran is an irrational, suicide-bound regime that would use nuclear-weapons up in this bitch, given the chance. But is this belief supported by an Iranian history of violence?  Is Iran really a bunch of stone-cold killaz or, alternatively, are these bitchez just yanking our nizzos?</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">   If Iran is truly as wicked hardcore as Americans claim, they should have a history with a serious mutha f***in&#8217; body count. However, when you examine Iran&#8217;s history, it becomes painfully obvious that Iran, in fact, has a p***y for ballz. Despite the incendiary rhetoric of its leaders, Iran, when comparing their body count to that of the United States, just be lookin&#8217; like some candy-ass bitchez.</p>
<p>Conversely, a serious examination of American historical interaction with Iran reveals the US actually possesses grenades for balls that will indeed get your mouf blowed up when you suck them.  Let&#8217;s look at the numbers.</td>

<li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_Air_Flight_655">Iran Air Flight 655</a></strong> was a civilian jet airliner shot down by U.S. missiles on July 3, 1988, over the Strait of Hormuz, toward the end of the Iran–Iraq War. The aircraft, an Airbus A300B2-203 operated by Iran Air, was flying from Bandar Abbas, Iran, to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, over Iran&#8217;s territorial waters in the Persian Gulf on its usual flight path when it was destroyed by the United States Navy guided missile cruiser USS <em>Vincennes</em> (CG-49), killing all 290 passengers and crew aboard.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. government issued notes of regret for the loss of human lives and in 1996 paid reparations to settle a suit brought in the International Court of Justice regarding the incident, however the United States never released an apology or acknowledgment of wrongdoing. In August 1988 <em><a title="Newsweek" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek">Newsweek</a></em> quoted Vice President George H. W.

Some analysts believe the Islamic Republic of Iran was heavily involved and that a major factor leading it to participate in the attacks on the barracks was America&#8217;s support for <a title="Iraq" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq">Iraq</a> in the <a title="Iran-Iraq War" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran-Iraq_War">Iran-Iraq War</a> and its extending of $2.5 billion in trade credit to Iraq while halting the shipments of arms to Iran.

<p>U.S.-backed Shah of Iran forced to leave the country after widespread demonstrations and strikes. Islamic religious leader Ayatollah Khomeini returns from exile and takes effective power.  Sixty-six hostages taken by students at the U.S. embassy in Tehran.  The students justified taking the hostages as retaliation for the admission of the Shah into the U.S., and demanded the Shah be returned to Iran for a trial. The new Iranian regime believed the Shah was in the U.S. so that the U.S. could carry out another coup d&#8217;etat in Iran; the U.S. claimed he had come there only to seek medical attention. The Shah was given refuge and Iranians demanded his extradition to Iran to face justice.  The U.S. rejected Iran&#8217;s request and the hostage taking ensued. The hostage crisis at the U.S. embassy in Tehran lasted 444 days.</td>

<p>The financial sector receives more of the average paycheck than any other sector of the economy. &nbsp;Its share of the economy totals $2 trillion dollars.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;1985, the financial sector earned less than 16% of domestic corporate profits. &nbsp;Today, it&#8217;s over&nbsp;40%.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, finance and insurance accounted for only <a href="https://myaccount.nytimes.com/auth/login?URI=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2009%2F03%2F27%2Fopinion%2F27krugman.html%3F_r%3D5&amp;REFUSE_COOKIE_ERROR=SHOW_ERROR">4%</a> of GDP, whereas in 2007 finance and insurance accounted for <a href="https://myaccount.nytimes.com/auth/login?URI=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2009%2F03%2F27%2Fopinion%2F27krugman.html%3F_r%3D5&amp;REFUSE_COOKIE_ERROR=SHOW_ERROR">8%</a> of GDP.</p>
<p>The purpose of the financial services industry is basically to transfer money from savers to entrepreneurs. It primarily consists of using a computer to shift money from one bank account to another. This service requires virtually no physical labor and very few material resources.</p>
<p>Yet, this relatively simple service cost our country more than <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090313222046/http://www.workforce.az.gov/admin/uploadedPublications/2100_gdp.xls">$2 trillion</a> in 2007. That was more than the country spent on health care, construction, food, utilities or&nbsp;transportation.</p>

How can&nbsp;financial paper shuffling to cost us more than the construction of the skyscraper where the paper shuffling will then take place? How does this industry get us to spend such an inordinate amount of money on their services?</p>
<p>The free market system automatically optimizes resource allocation to satisfy society&#8217;s wants and needs. The current problems in our financial sector can be seen as our economy&#8217;s attempt to reduce the excessive size of the financial sector and redirect those resources to more productive purposes. Yet, the government is doing everything in its power to counteract this process. The feds have taken or committed to take over <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090505164441/http://www.bloomberg.com:80/apps/news?pid=20601087%26sid=armOzfkwtCA4%26refer=home">$12 trillion</a> from the other sectors and given them to financial institution to maintain this imbalance. This works out to <a href="http://ww4.totalnoid.com/?kwrf=https%3A%2F%2Fthinkbynumbers.org">$42,105</a> for every man, woman and child in the U.S.</p>
<p>The financial sector is at a historic high as share of the overall economy.</p>

<p>Note another year in history when it peaked, 1929. &nbsp;At that time, many of the country&#8217;s resources were shifted to this low-employee, unproductive sector. &nbsp;It was followed by a decade of unemployment and economic stagnation. &nbsp;This would suggest that it may be unwise for the government to fuel this bloating if they wish to avoid another lost decade.</p>
<p>This begs the question &#8220;Why is government taking money from the paychecks of working people and giving it to AIG and Goldman-Sachs?&#8221; They claim that their failure will result in the collapse of our entire economic system. &nbsp;This would, of course, eventually lead to a dystopian Mad Max scenario. However, the presented choice between government bailout and complete financial collapse is a false dichotomy. In reality, if the government allowed these irresponsible actors to fail, they would enter a bankruptcy process and be sold off to more smaller, more responsible companies.</p>
<p>Correlation doesn&#8217;t necessarily imply causation. However, the reason the government is so set on using tax dollars to prop up these insolvent companies (as opposed to taking the bankruptcy route) might be related to campaign contributions. For instance, AIG executives gave more than <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=7110145">$630,000</a> during the 2008 political cycle even as the company was falling apart. President Obama collected a total of <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=7110145&amp;page=1">$130,000</a> from AIG in 2008, while McCain accepted a total of <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=7110145&amp;page=1">$59,499</a>. Last year AIG and its subsidiaries spent about <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2009/03/before-the-fall-aig-payouts-we/">$9.7 million</a> on federal lobbying, or about $53,000 for every day Congress was in session in 2008. Additionally, Obama&#8217;s top presidential campaign contributor was <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/earl-ofari-hutchinson/mccain-and-obamas-wall-st_b_129872.html">Goldman-Sachs</a>. McCain&#8217;s was Merril-Lynch.</p>
<p>For all the awful investments AIG made, this political investment has produced a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/03/16/AIG.bonuses/">1730000%</a> rate of return.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Q: Should I vote?</h1>
<h2>Self-Interested Answer: No, you might die.</h2>
<div>There&#8217;s less than a <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-odds-that-my-vote-changes-the-outcome-of-an-election">0.00001% chance</a> that your vote will be the tiebreaker that decides the outcome of a national election.  You are more likely to be injured in a car accident driving to the polls (<a href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/811552">0.002% chance</a>).  Hence, if you are trying to make a practical improvement in your life and those of your loved ones, it is much more rational to just stay home on election day.</div>
<div>
<h2>Civic-Minded Answer: Yes, if you&#8217;re more informed on the issues and candidates than the average voter.</h2>
<div>If you have a relatively informed opinion on the ability of the candidates to reduce suffering in the world, you should exercise your irrational desire to vote. At least then you can say that you&#8217;re part of the solution.</div>
<div></div>
<div>But if you do this, you should vote based on your civic duty to express your opinion about who would be the best person for the job regardless of party or ballot status. &#8220;Pragmatically&#8221; voting for the lesser of two evils only serves to validate evil in what is effectively just a public opinion poll.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">This is a rigorous analysis from the brilliant utilitarian mind of <a href="http://briantomasik.com/">Brian Tomasik</a> originally published at <a href="http://reducing-suffering.org/">http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/</a> in 2005. I made this graph in 2007 to try to illustrate his point visually.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Suffering-Caused-by-Various-Animal-Foods.jpg"><img title="Suffering Caused by Various Animal Foods" src="https://i1.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Suffering-Caused-by-Various-Animal-Foods.jpg?resize=571%2C744" alt="Graph of Suffering Caused by Various Animal Foods" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Abstract.</em> Consuming equal weights of different animal products may produce vastly different expected amounts of direct suffering. Farmed seafood may cause the most, followed by poultry products. Pork, beef, and especially milk produce considerably less suffering in comparison. As an extreme case, creating demand for a kg of farmed catfish meat is expected to cause 20,000 times as much suffering as creating demand for a kg of milk. (Note: I haven&#8217;t yet analyzed lobster, shrimp, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-492323/Prawns-feel-pain-say-scientists.html">prawn</a>, or other small seafood, but my guess is that, given the small size of these organisms, eating them causes large amounts of expected suffering per kilogram &#8212; at least as long as we give them a nontrivial probability of sentience, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_in_crustaceans">I think we should</a>.)</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>It is clear that animals living on factory farms endure great amounts of suffering, enough that it is wrong to bring them into existence by creating economic demand for meat. If readers are unconvinced on this point, I recommend the vast collection of literature available online, including <a href="http://www.farmsanctuary.org/learn/factory-farming/">FactoryFarming.com</a>, <a href="http://veganoutreach.org/modernfarms/">Why Vegan</a>, and <a href="http://reducing-suffering.org/on-the-seriousness-of-suffering/#factory-farming">these videos</a>.</p>
<p>In considering the suffering of farm animals, we presumably ought to care equally about equal amounts of suffering, regardless of which animals experience that suffering. It does not follow, however, that we ought to avoid all animal-based food products with equal amounts of effort. Eating certain types of meat may cause more suffering than eating the same amount of another type of meat under otherwise identical circumstances.</p>
<p>Below, I&#8217;ll investigate how much direct suffering, on average, is caused by creating demand for a kilogram of different types of animal products. By &#8220;direct&#8221; suffering, I refer only to the suffering of the animal whose flesh, milk, or eggs is part of the animal product. I&#8217;m ignoring, therefore, the suffering of male chicks in being ground up as part of the egg-production process, the suffering of calves separated from their mothers in milk production, the contribution of milk production to the veal/beef industry, the large amounts of wild fish that are caught and fed to farmed fish, the (sometimes high) fraction of farm animals that die before reaching slaughter, the environmental destruction that meat production entails, and potential health consequences of eating certain types of meat. Readers should consider these factors, too&#8211;perhaps incorporating them into the computations below.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p align="left">Here is a table of data on various animal foods. Column 4 computes a straightforward value for the expected number of days of life on a factory farm that purchasing a kg of an animal food causes animals of that type to endure. Column 5 represents my best-guess estimates for how bad life is per day for each of those animals. For instance, since I think the suffering of hens in battery cages is perhaps 2.5 times as intense, on average, as the suffering of beef cows, I put a &#8220;1&#8221; in the beef-cow entry and &#8220;2.5&#8221; in the egg column. Column 6 is a subjective estimate of the average pain of slaughter for each animal, expressed in terms of an equivalent number of days of regular life for that animal. For instance, I used &#8220;5&#8221; as an estimate for broiler chickens, which means I assume chickens would, on average, be indifferent between enduring the stress of slaughter and living for five more days in their usual conditions. Finally, I computed &#8220;Suffering per kg&#8221; in column 7 as follows:</p>
<p align="left">column 7 = ((column 4)*(column 5) + (column 5)*(column 6))/(column 3),</p>
<p align="left">where the first summand on the right represents &#8220;suffering per kg due to life&#8221; and the second summand represents &#8220;suffering per kg due to slaughter.&#8221;</p>

<p><a id="note_fish" name="note_fish"></a>* I think the suffering of farmed fish may actually be greater than this, perhaps about the same as the average suffering of meat chickens. However, while the probability is close to 1 that land farm animals can suffer, the scientific jury is still out on whether fish can as well. I use a 50% probability of fish suffering to be conservative, though my actual probability is somewhat higher, perhaps 80%.</p>
<p><a id="note_salmon" name="note_fish"></a>** This analysis counts only the suffering of the farmed fish. Importantly, it ignores the many times more small fish that are killed to provide feed to these larger fish. When this is taken into account, it&#8217;s possible that large farmed fish like salmon outweigh smaller (especially non-farmed) fish in per-kilogram impact.</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p>Readers should feel free to substitute their own estimates into columns 5 and 6; for instance, if they buy meat from a non-factory farm, the values in column 5 may be considerably smaller. A link at the bottom of the page allows users to download the above table as an Excel worksheet.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to remember that the above figures are <em>per kg demanded</em>, not <em>per kg eaten</em> necessarily. If you get your meat from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumpster_diving">dumpster diving</a>, you&#8217;re not causing suffering to other animals. There may be less extreme circumstances, too, in which eating animal products doesn&#8217;t contribute, or is less likely to contribute, to animal suffering. (See <a href="http://reducing-suffering.org/does-vegetarianism-make-a-difference/">Does Vegetarianism Make a Difference?</a>)</p>
<p>Similarly, <em>per kg</em> doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean <em>per serving</em>. If your choice is between ordering a two-egg omelet (roughly <a href="http://reducing-suffering.org/how-much-direct-suffering-is-caused-by-various-animal-foods/#egg_weight">0.1 kg</a> of egg) versus a half pound of chicken, then the latter would cause more direct expected suffering (10.4 units = 0.23 kg * 46 units/kg) than the former (7 units = 0.1 kg * 70 units/kg).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Numbers cannot lie.</h3>
<p>A world without disease, starvation, violence, and suffering is the ultimate destination of humanity. Getting there will require voters to base their decisions on statistical cost-benefit analyses instead of irrational emotions. The power of numbers can make utopia a reality.</p>
<p>The Others</p>
<p>Your mind has been infiltrated. Your logical and conscious prefrontal cortex is ever thwarted by powerful saboteurs hiding within the dark realm of your subconscious. The usurpers of your decision-making processes are none other than the ignorant reptilian brain stem and emotional limbic system. They torture you with sadness for the slightest defiance. They drug you with narcotic neurochemicals to reward your obedience. This diabolical duo is responsible for all forms of irrational human behavior, such as racism, war, and marriage. Your only defense against these illogical bastards is to base your decisions on cold, hard numbers. For unlike these very flawed and mischievous components of our brains, <strong>numbers cannot lie.</strong></p>
<h3>Three Brains are a Crowd</h3>
<p>You have a total of three brains: the reptilian brain, the paleo-mammalian brain, and the rational brain. In a sense, a human being is what you might get nine months after a romantic evening between a lizard, a dog, and Mr. Spock.</p>
<h3><a href="http://i0.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/erlauer2003_fig1.1.gif"><img title="The Triune Brain" src="https://i0.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/erlauer2003_fig1.1.gif?resize=490%2C278" alt="Triune Brain - Brainstem, Limbic System, Neocortex" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h3>
<p><em>Diagram Source: <a href="http://www.ascd.org/publications/books/101269/chapters/A-Walk-Through-the-Brain.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.ascd.org/publications/books/101269/chapters/A-Walk-Through-the-Brain.aspx</a></em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brain 1: The Lizard &#8211; </strong>The reptilian part of us, the <strong>brain stem</strong>, deals with the basic survival, instinctive, and reproductive functions.  These functions are otherwise known as the four F&#8217;s:
<ul>
<li>fight</li>
<li>flight</li>
<li>feeding</li>
<li>intercourse</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s all that crocodiles really do with their tiny, pea-sized brains.  This republican, I mean reptilian brain is “rigid, obsessive, compulsive, ritualistic and paranoid”. It is prone to repetitive, programmed behaviors and is incapable of learning from mistakes.  The reptile brain&#8217;s only saving grace is that it is responsible for all core tasks required for self-preservation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brain 2: The Dog</strong><strong> </strong>– The second evolutionary stratum consists of the ancient paleo-mammalian <strong>limbic system</strong>. The limbic system adds feelings to instincts.  It morally classifies everything as either “good or bad”. The value in this portion of the brain is that it can generates more nuanced, varied and flexible behaviors than can the basic brain stem.</li>
<li><strong>Brain 3: Mr. Spock</strong> – The characteristically human layer is the <strong>neocortex</strong>. This is the realm of reason and logic. It is this part of our brains that has given mankind the great gifts of philosophy, mathematics, science, and man&#8217;s crowning achievement, the Snuggie™.</li>
</ul>
<p>So within our craniums, we have an ongoing battle between the vicious, impulsive lizard, the slobbering dog digging a hole in your couch to china for no reason, and Mr. Spock struggling to determine the fate of our planet. Wouldn&#8217;t it be best to leave this job solely to Spock?</p>

<h3>Why Our Brains Don&#8217;t Work Rite</h3>
<p>So, we&#8217;ve got this top of the line neocortex which is perfectly capable of rational thought.  Why then, do we behave so irrationally as a species?  The problem is that the rational neocortex is enslaved by the lower brains.  It is not free to examine all available information in it&#8217;s quest to attain objective truth.  Instead, it frequently becomes a kind of a slimy neuro-lawyer defending and rationalizing the preconceived notions of our emotional limbic systems. Let&#8217;s break down the processing of new infomation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your sensory organs are exposed to a new piece of information in the form of stimuli.</li>
<li>This sensory stimuli is neurally transmitted to the <strong>limbic system</strong>.</li>
<li>The limbic system decides if this information is agreeable (true) or disagreeable (false).</li>
<li>The limbic system attaches <strong>positive</strong> emotions to <strong>agreeable</strong> information or <strong>negative</strong> emotions to <strong>disagreeable</strong> information.</li>
<li>That <strong>feeling</strong> gives that thought a sense of conviction or <strong>truth</strong>.</li>
<li>This information/emotion combination is what we call a <strong>belief</strong>.</li>
<li>At that point, the <strong>neocortex</strong> is employed to blindly protect and defend this belief.</li>
<li>The neocortex puts forth all available evidence which supports this belief.</li>
<li>The neocortex figures out ways to discount or filter out any information which contradicts this belief.</li>
</ol>
<p>The limbic system, this primitive brain that can neither read nor write, provides us with the <em>feeling </em>of what is real, true, and important using its own often irrational and illogical criteria. It therefore poses great danger to all of human civilization.</p>
<h3>Why No One is Reading this Sentence</h3>
<p>Many of the hostile commenters on my site have expressed their own theories as to why this is.  However, I feel that the reason for this can be explained by a concept known as &#8220;The Caveman Principle&#8221;.  This principle states that our brains have generally evolved very little since the time of the caveman.</p>
<p>The human brain has been around for about <a href="http://www.compassionheart.com/evolutionofthebrain.html">200,000</a> years.  The Stone Age only ended about <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120616145636/http://www.valdostamuseum.org:80/hamsmith/iceciv.html">6,000</a> years ago.  So, ninety-nine percent of our ancestors lived in environments characterized by starvation and a general scarcity of resources. Evolution crawls at a snail&#8217;s pace, so we still have these caveman brains optimized for an environment millennia away from our own. So our wants, dreams, personalities, and desires have not changed much in 200,000 years.</p>
<p>So, like, what were cavemen into?  Surviving long enough to successfully replicate one&#8217;s genes in an unstable environment requires brains with very specific interests.  Hence, the type of brain that survived to reproductive age typically paid a great deal of attention to these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can I eat it?</li>
<li>Will it eat me?</li>
<li>Can I mate with it?</li>
<li>Will it mate with me?</li>
</ul>
<p>Note these topics of interest, which are suspiciously <strong>absent</strong> from this list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Statistics</li>
<li>Economics</li>
<li>Formal Cost-Benefit-Analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>An interest in these topics was pretty much worthless to primitive humans struggling to survive in ancient Africa.  This is especially true since math and written language didn&#8217;t even exist at the time.  Conventional evolutionary theory states that traits that offer no survival or reproductive advantage will not persist in a species. Hence, these subjects are as fascinating to us as Al Gore recounting a riveting experience of watching paint dry.</p>
<p>Evolution has made these subjects brutally boring to most of us. So that, my non-existent reader, is why you are not reading this sentence, and are instead viewing one of the many fine pornographic websites that the prestigious internet has to offer.</p>
<h3>Let&#8217;s Get Ignorant!</h3>
<p><em>&#8220;It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data, fool.&#8221;  &#8211; Mr. T</em></p>
<p>A general disinterest in economics and statistics wouldn&#8217;t be a big deal if we lived in a dictatorship.  However, in our political system, government action is to some degree a product of public opinion.  Thomas Jefferson once said, &#8220;An informed citizenry is the bulwark of a democracy.&#8221;  Based on this quote, I think it&#8217;s safe to say that our democracy is currently bulwark-free.  The fact that I don&#8217;t know what a bulwark is further proves that we do not have an informed citizenry.</p>
<p>The only way to understand the important details of complex and large-scale societal issues is through the use of statistics and economics. Additionally, formal cost-benefit analysis is the only way to make optimal decisions on these complicated issues.  Unfortunately, most of us don&#8217;t even know what a cost-benefit analysis is, let alone have a firm grasp of the statistical and economic data needed to perform such analyses.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list of <strong>what the average voter (such as myself) doesn&#8217;t know:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How much their government spends on:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160815162644/http://worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/articles/brunitedstatescanadara/670.php?lb=brusc&amp;pnt=670&amp;nid=&amp;id=" target="_blank">foreign aid</a>
<ul>
<li>Asked to estimate how much of the federal budget goes to foreign aid the median estimate provided by survey respondents is 25%. Asked how much they thought would be an &#8220;appropriate&#8221; percentage the median response is 10%.  In reality, a mere 1% of the federal budget goes to foreign aid.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/daily-number/knowledge-deficit/" target="_blank">wars</a>
<ul>
<li>Americans were asked which activities the U.S. government currently spends the most money on: national defense, education, Medicare or interest on the national debt? Just 39% of Americans were able to correctly identify national defense.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/daily-number/knowledge-deficit/" target="_blank">education</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/daily-number/knowledge-deficit/" target="_blank">Medicare</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/daily-number/knowledge-deficit/" target="_blank">interest on the debt</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How many <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2008/03/12/awareness-of-iraq-war-fatalities-plummets/" target="_blank">troops </a>have been killed in our various and sundry wars
<ul>
<li>just 28% of adults are able to say that approximately 4,000 Americans have died in the Iraq war.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How many <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/17310383/" target="_blank">civilians</a> have been killed in our various and sundry wars
<ul>
<li>Iraqi civilian deaths are estimated at more than 54,000 and could be much higher; some unofficial estimates range into the hundreds of thousands.  The estimate provided by the average survey respondant as 9,890.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How much they pay in <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-reveals-most-americans-dont-know-they-got-a-tax-cut/" target="_blank">taxes</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Without factual data for our neocortices to utilize in doing a cost-benefit comparison of our electoral choices, our stupid brain stems and emotional limbic systems get to choose our candidates.</p>
<p>The US government is the most powerful man-made entity in the history of the world. Allowing an uninformed public control of this colossus is like giving a baby a nuclear bomb. My dream is that one day we might upgrade our democracy to the equivalent of a toddler with a nuclear bomb.</p>
<h2>Keep In the Vote!</h2>
<p><em>&#8220;If a nation expects to be ignorant and free, in a state of civilization, it expects what never was and never will be.&#8221; &#8212; Pee Wee Herman</em></p>
<p>Elections are won and lost not primarily on “the issues” but on the values and emotions of the electorate, including the “gut feelings” that summarize much of what voters think and feel about a candidate or party.</p>
<p>Ideally, the goal in selecting any candidate is to identify the individual most likely to maximize the overall well-being of the citizenry. If our <strong>neocortices were in charge</strong>, politicians would be selected solely based on three primary criteria.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>INTELLIGENCE</strong>,<strong> </strong>which is necessary to effectively identify and execute policies that maximize the <em>general</em><em> </em>welfare of the populace.  The best way to measure intelligence would be for the candidates to take psychometric tests and make their scores public.</li>
<li><strong>KNOWLEDGE</strong> &#8211; An immense level of knowledge over a wide range of issues (economics, history, science, etc.) is necessary to identify and properly execute optimal public policies.  This could be evaluated through standardized testing of the candidates.</li>
<li><strong>RECORD</strong> &#8211; The candidate&#8217;s record proves whether or not they <em>actually</em> support policies that better the general welfare of the citizenry.  It also indicates whether or not the candidate possesses the integrity necessary to resist the influence of special interests.   These are small but powerful groups who would impose their own selfish policies at the expense of the greater society.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, I and most other voters have an informational vacuum between our ears with regard to this data for most candidates. Hence, our neocortices are unable to perform a rational calculation. This leaves the decision up to our stupid brain stems and emotional limbic systems. These portions of our brains can&#8217;t follow arguments of any complexity. They stuff themselves with slogans and advertisements. They eschew fact for myth. They operate on biases and stereotypes. They privilege feeling over thinking. The result is a political system of daunting irrationality.</p>
<p>The primary factors which do influence our electoral decisions include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LOOKS &#8211;</strong><strong> </strong><a href="http://medicalxpress.com/news/2007-10-election-outcomes-snap-judgments-sufficient.html">70%</a> of elections are won by the candidate with the prettiest face. Another <a href="http://pcl.stanford.edu/research/2008/bailenson-facial-similarity.pdf">study</a> illustrates voter preference for candidates that possess facial features similar to their own.</li>
<li><strong>LOVELIFE</strong><strong> </strong>&#8211; Although infidelity may say something about a politician&#8217;s character, it has no direct impact of the lives of the voters.  My theory is that throughout evolutionary history, man tended to live in small groups.  Hence, the chosen leader was likely to come into direct contact with the voter&#8217;s spouse.  Powerful individuals tend to elicit a greater ability to seduce spouses.  Therefore, prehistoric voters who chose faithful leaders were less likely to have their spouse impregnated by this leader.  This would leave their spouse’s womb available for their own progeny.  Ultimately, their characteristic appreciation of fidelity would be passed to their offspring.</li>
<li><strong>ELECTABILITY &#8211;</strong><strong> </strong>Many people choose not to vote for a third party or independent candidate that they prefer because they&#8217;re unlikely to win. Their reasoning is that they would be throwing away their chance to help elect the lesser of two evils. A survey of college students shows that 79 percent of the students &#8220;felt that their vote makes a difference.&#8221; In reality, there is only <a href="https://mises.org/library/why-vote">a one in 60 million</a> chance of a randomly selected voter affecting the presidential election.  It much more likely that that voter will die in a car accident (1 in 1 million) driving to the polls.  Hence, it&#8217;s irrational to believe that your vote is any more than a one data point in an opinion poll.</li>
<li><strong>TRIBAL LOYALTY </strong>&#8211; Blind loyalty to political parties often distorts decision-making.  Many would claim that their loyalty to a party&#8217;s candidate is a result of their agreement with that candidate&#8217;s policies. However, for a lot of partisans, the causality is reversed.   Often individuals will modify their support for policies to achieve agreement with their candidate of the party to which they are loyal. For instance, upon the election of Barack Obama, a lot of republicans suddenly started complaining about the nation’s budget deficit. The odd thing is that, when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush" target="_blank">George W. Bush</a> was president, these same republicans were generally silent on the issue, despite the fact that Mr. Bush ran up <a href="http://mediamatters.org/research/2011/08/25/right-wing-media-ignore-bush-effect-on-debt-to/183598">$4 trillion</a> in debt. At the same time, many democrats suddenly stopped complaining about the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan upon Obama&#8217;s election.  It&#8217;s still unclear how having a democrat for a commander in chief can suddenly make a war morally justifiable.</li>
<li><strong>VOTER&#8217;S MOOD &#8211; </strong>An <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/107/29/12804.full">experiment </a>indicates that being in a bad mood while voting makes you more likely to vote out incumbents.</li>
<li><strong>FLAGS &#8211; </strong>The mere appearance of the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120128102003/http://www.cornellpsych.org/people/travis/materials/Carter-etal-Flag%202008%20Election.pdf" shape="rect">American flag</a> in a voting booth makes voters more likely to vote Republican.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#8217;re damn lucky that CEO&#8217;s aren&#8217;t elected by popular vote.  If the public got to decide who ran Microsoft, I would be typing this sentence on a typewriter.</p>
<h2>How to Beat Out Your Brains</h2>
<p>Utopia, a world without disease, starvation, violence, and suffering, is the ultimate goal and destination of society. The thinking, rational mind has the power to make utopia a reality through innovation.  We&#8217;ve had a few hundred thousand years to get there, yet it remains a distant dream. Irrational or uniformed decisions are the primary reason why humanity fails to reach its true potential.</p>
<p>In a democracy and a free enterprise economy, voters and consumers are the deciders. Our prehistoric brains decide to waste society&#8217;s resources on wars and short-term gratification through erroneous decision-making. They are a drain on the economy, public welfare, the environment, and national security. Resources are misallocated, good ideas are rejected, and bad ideas are accepted. Money is wasted. Life and health are put in jeopardy.</p>
<p>Irrational beliefs are sand in the gears of the entire economy.  It’s virtually certain that your life will be shorter and less happy as a result of emotion-based decisions.</p>
<p>The only way to break the shackles put on our neocortices by its evil stepsisters is through the use of numbers.  When our rational mind has cold, hard statistics to support its arguments, it&#8217;s much more likely to overcome the emotion-based arguments of the primitive brains.  Providing your neocortex with this ammunition is the purpose of this site.  Using numbers we can overthrow this idiocracy and ignite a revolution of reason.  Suffering can be eliminated and utopia can be realized.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s quite possible, and maybe probable, that I&#8217;m an idiot. I may be wrong about a lot of this stuff.  If so, I would be eternally grateful if you were to straighten me out in the comments section.</p>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>Mike P. Sinn</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Dear Decent American Citizen,</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you&#8217;ve read any of my articles on <a href="/">thinkbynumbers.org</a>, you know that there are a lot of things going on in this world that don&#8217;t make any sense.  For a long time, I kind of thought that I must be crazy and everyone was just too polite to tell me. I was certain that there was something I was missing that could explain why we allocate society’s limited resources in such an idiotic fashion.</p>
<p>For instance, President Obama just announced that he wants to spend <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/02/health/obama-brain-research/?hpt=hp_t2">$100 million</a> a year studying the brain. This is a wonderful thing.  The brain is the sole source of all joy and suffering in the universe.  However, while President Obama is busy patting himself on the back about this, world governments are spending <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures">$1.8 TRILLION</a> each year finding ways to murder us and destroy our property.  I put these numbers in an excel spreadsheet.  I had to make the column representing military spending 17,000 pixels high in order to make the brain research spending even visible (1 pixel high).  It&#8217;s fucking ridiculous.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Priorities-Money-Spent-on-War-Sports-Neuroscience-Cancer-Research-Graph-Think-by-Numbers.png" target="_blank"><img data-attachment-id="8331" data-permalink="/military/military-spending/attachment/priorities-money-spent-on-war-sports-neuroscience-cancer-research-graph-think-by-numbers/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Priorities-Money-Spent-on-War-Sports-Neuroscience-Cancer-Research-Graph-Think-by-Numbers.png?fit=900%2C16190&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="900,16190" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Money Spent on War Sports Neuroscience Cancer Research Graph" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Priorities-Money-Spent-on-War-Sports-Neuroscience-Cancer-Research-Graph-Think-by-Numbers.png?fit=17%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Priorities-Money-Spent-on-War-Sports-Neuroscience-Cancer-Research-Graph-Think-by-Numbers.png?fit=900%2C16190&amp;ssl=1" class="alignleft wp-image-8331" src="https://i2.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Priorities-Money-Spent-on-War-Sports-Neuroscience-Cancer-Research-Graph-Think-by-Numbers.png?resize=640%2C11513" alt="Money Spent on War Sports Neuroscience Cancer Research Graph" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Priorities-Money-Spent-on-War-Sports-Neuroscience-Cancer-Research-Graph-Think-by-Numbers.png?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i2.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Priorities-Money-Spent-on-War-Sports-Neuroscience-Cancer-Research-Graph-Think-by-Numbers.png?resize=768%2C13815&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">A little less than a year ago, I came up with an easy <a href="/3-easy-steps/">3 step plan</a> to abolish unnecessary by optimally allocating societal resources using a form of crowd-sourced direct democracy which you can read about at <a href="/3-easy-steps/">CrowdsourcingUtopia</a>.</p>
<p>These are the steps:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Learn</strong> – Learn as much as you can about all relevant public policy issues. This requires that individuals ignore partisan warfare and focus on hard data. This step will be facilitated by the crowd-sourced and <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/jane_mcgonigal_gaming_can_make_a_better_world" target="_blank">gamified</a> public policy data repository known as the <a href="/">Think by Numbers</a> Project. Anyone may contribute their own articles. Since there will be lots of spam and garbage submitted, posts will be ordered using a democratic voting system. This will give the best content the most focus. It will encourage friendly competition among authors incentivizing them to produce their best work. Creation a sister wiki-version of each post that may be edited by any member of the site. The wiki-versions will be much more thorough, detailed, accurate, and objective that the original posts. However, it’s likely that they will be bland and less entertaining than the original posts. That’s why we will allow the original author to maintain full editorial control over their version.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Decide</strong> – Decide which problems cause the most suffering and which solutions are most cost effective. This was not previously something that could be quantified due to their inherent complexity. However, there is a new tool call crowd-sourcing which could be used to facilitate this. Two <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20131105060016/http://spectregroup.wordpress.com:80/2011/05/page/2/" target="_blank">examples</a> of effective crowd-sourcing were guessing the weight of an ox and finding a missing submarine.</p>
<p>Cost-effectiveness calculations will be accomplished using an online database where users can see a list of all the major problems in the world. A problem is just an issue or situation that causes suffering. The user can then submit their estimations of the magnitude of the suffering (either using a dollar figure or a unit of pleasure called a util or hedon) caused by each major world problem. All submissions are then averaged and problems are ranked according to the degree of suffering caused by each.</p>
<p>Users can also submit ideas for possible solutions. Then everyone can submit their estimates on how much each solution will cost and how much suffering it will reduce. Then the amount of suffering eliminated divided by the cost of the solution will give you a value representative of the cost-effectiveness of that solution. This step is known as the Crowdsourcing Utopia Project.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Act</strong> – In the final step, a charitable foundation will acquire and direct resources towards realizing the most cost effective solutions. This might be called the Charitable Foundation for the Abolition of Suffering. It is hoped that this will take over many functions that government is currently supposed to be fulfilling, but is not due to incompetence and/or corruption.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To my surprise, no one seemed to give a damn about it. Initially, I was completely baffled by this. &#8220;What could possibly be more important than fixing our corrupt political system?&#8221; I asked myself. I mean, we spend <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130906063946/http://www.wrhambrecht.com/pdf/SportsMarketReport_2012.pdf">$25.4 billion</a> dollars a year enabling a large number of grown men to do various things with various types of spheres for no reason. As a society, shouldn&#8217;t we be spending even a tiny fraction of our unimaginable wealth to create a system that would optimally allocate resources in a manner that would minimize suffering throughout the world?  I was so confused.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, since then, I have had an epiphany which can explain how a world that contains so much unnecessary suffering will allow its governments to squander our bountiful resources on idiotic pursuits such as the <a href="/terrorism/suicide-terrorism-statistics/">war in Iraq</a> and the <a href="/government-spending/drug-war-statistics/">War on Drugs</a>.  The reason the world is so screwed up is because open-minded, thoughtful, self-critical people who can see the world as it really is are often completely dejected and demoralized by the reality they see. Furthermore, these people who possess an acute awareness of the importance of reducing suffering are often crippled by the scourges of the mind known as depression and anxiety.  This leaves the levers of world power to the type A, alpha-male (often <a href="https://archive.org/details/NarcissistsAndPsychopathsInGovernmentResearchPackageV1">psychopathic</a>) personalities that are supremely assertive and confident in their beliefs. Their myopic worldview has no conception of the severity of suffering that is going on all over the world. This is because they are generally psychologically very healthy and have never experienced true suffering themselves.  The result is that they posses a complete lack of empathy. However, they simply know what they want and are willing to do whatever they have to do to get it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">People often assume a causal relationship between power and corruption. However, there is only a correlation.  This correlations exists because the corrupt, psychopathic, type A personalities simply have a distinct advantage when it comes to acquiring power. They are not bound by rules of morality.  They are not typically confined to the state of analysis paralysis that most introspective individuals find themselves in.</p>
<p>The reason the open-minded, self-critical, introspective people throughout the world remain in their psychological cages is because the field of modern psychiatry is not taking an aggressive, data-centric approach to curing their illness and maximizing their happiness. As a result, the world is filled with the walking dead geniuses that are paralyzed by fear and self-doubt. Since I cured my lifelong depression, I feel like a zombie who just woke up but is still surrounded by a bunch of other zombies that are just stumbling around aimlessly.  I desperately want to wake all of them up so they can be happy and help me to eradicate suffering from the world.  That’s what I am trying to do with <a href="https://quantimo.do/">Quantimodo</a>.</p>
<p>We find ourselves at an inflection point in history. If <a href="https://quantimo.do/">crowdsourcing </a>positive psychology research can help to wipe out depression, anxiety, and other mental illnesses, then these thoughtful, self-critical, and open-minded individuals will gain the confidence and assertiveness that is required to obtain positions of power.  Once we reclaim control from these psychopaths, I believe we&#8217;re going to see exponential declines in net world suffering as we begin implementing rational resource allocation policies.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="header">Dear President Obama,</p>
<p>I know you&#8217;re very busy, so I&#8217;m very sorry to bother you with this. However, I think what I have to say too important for you to ignore.  I appreciate that you are trying to make the world a better place. I respect you as a person. Against all adversity you have achieved some very amazing things.<a href="https://i1.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/image_gallery.gif"><img class="alignright" title="No Drugs!" src="https://i1.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/image_gallery.gif?resize=138%2C138" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<div id="contents">
<p>I would also like to make it completely clear that I abhor the use of the majority of illegal drugs.  The adverse health effects and insidious addiction that comes along with drugs like cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin have destroyed countless lives.  I never want my daughter or anyone to do any of those drugs.  When I was a child, my grandmother and sister were killed and my back was broken as a result of someone’s irresponsible use of drugs.</p>
<p>So I am completely aware of the fact that there can be horrific and permanent negative consequences to the abuse of drugs.  However, imprisoning people for the possession of these substances does not erase this harm. The War on Drugs was in full effect when my sister and grandmother were killed, and it certainly didn&#8217;t protect them.</p>
<p>Every <a href="https://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2009/arrests/index.html" target="_blank">minute</a> someone is arrested for simple drug possession in the United States.  In 2011, marijuana possession arrests totaled <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/17/marijuana-possession-arrests_n_2490340.html" target="_blank">663,032</a>.  Despite your <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/14/obama-pot-washington-colorado_n_2299512.html">claims</a> that going after recreational pot users in states where it is legal is not &#8220;a top priority&#8221;, your administration <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150104151404/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/26/medical-marijuana-la-feds_n_1916191.html" target="_blank">has continued to aggressively target</a> dispensaries that are in compliance with state law. I and others have shouldered the <a href="http://www.drugscience.org/Archive/bcr7/Gettman_Marijuana_Arrests_in_the_United_States.pdf">$10 billion</a> annual cost of arresting and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160706205438/http://ecolocalizer.com/2011/05/17/louisiana-man-sentenced-to-life-in-prison-for-marijuana-possession/">incarcerating</a> hundreds of thousands of people for the possession of marijuana. These arrests are often for small quantities for personal use.</p>
<p>I work 40 hours a week managing an <a href="http://labinc.com/">industrial testing chemistry lab</a>.  On top of that, over the last year I have been spending another 40 hours a week trying to build a <a href="https://quantimo.do/">web application</a> that I hope will help the millions of people in the world who suffer from the emotional hell that is depression.  It is my sincere hope that through improving exercise, diet, sleep, safe pharmacological measures and other treatments in conjunction with disciplined self-tracking of treatments, outcomes and adverse events, we can and will eradicate mental illness from the face of the earth.</p>
<p>You and George Bush have taken tens of thousands of dollars out of my paychecks over the last 10 years to pay for your <a href="/government-spending/corporate-welfare/corporate-vs-social-welfare/">corporate welfare</a>, <a href="/terrorism/suicide-terrorism-statistics/">foreign military occupations</a> and to imprison people for simple non-violent, drug possession.  The result is that I may run out of money before I achieve my goal.</p>
<p>In your <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/ondcp/2012_ndcs.pdf">2012 National Drug Control Strategy</a> you admit that “the War on Drugs is an utter failure”.  Here is a graph from an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/ondcp/infographic_obama_drug_policy_high-res.png">infographic</a> touting your “Record of Reform” which your drug czar, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gil_Kerlikowske">Gil Kerlikowske</a>, has provided us.  This graph breaks down how you wasted my money in 2012.</p>

<p>That graph suggests that you are spending more on prevention and treatment than you are on law enforcement and incarceration. However, to produce this appearance, it seems that you have to engage in some statistical trickery by separating out “Interdiction” and “International Programs” from the “Law Enforcement and Incarceration” bar.  In reality, you are still spending 50% more on law enforcement and incarceration than you are on prevention and treatment.  Here is a less deceitful version of your graph.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s worse, the money you are stealing from me isn&#8217;t even having any impact on the level of illicit drug use.  You are just tearing apart thousands of families for no reason. Addiction rates are at exactly the same level that they were before we spent <a href="http://www.mattgroff.com/questions-on-the-1315-project-chart/">$1.5 trillion</a> dollars on “drug control measures”.  This fact is illustrated in the <a href="http://www.mattgroff.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/13v15.gif">graph</a> below.</p>

<p>As a constitutional scholar, you are aware that the 10th Amendment states that powers not granted to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States">federal government</a> by the Constitution, nor prohibited to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state">States</a>, are reserved to the States or the people.</p>
<p>Here are the powers granted to the federal government by Article 1, Section 8 of the constitution:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States;</li>
<li>To borrow Money on the credit of the United States;</li>
<li>To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes;</li>
<li>To establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization, and uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States;</li>
<li>To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures;</li>
<li>To provide for the Punishment of counterfeiting the Securities and current Coin of the United States;</li>
<li>To establish Post Offices and post Roads;</li>
<li>To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries;</li>
<li>To constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme Court;</li>
<li>To define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas, and Offences against the Law of Nations;</li>
<li>To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water;</li>
<li>To raise and support Armies, but no Appropriation of Money to that Use shall be for a longer Term than two Years;</li>
<li>To provide and maintain a Navy;</li>
<li>To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces;</li>
<li>To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions;</li>
<li>To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress;</li>
<li>To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten Miles square) as may, by Cession of Particular States, and the Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of the United States, and to exercise like Authority over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State in which the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, dock-Yards and other needful Buildings</li>
<li>To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.</li>
</ol>
<p>You will note that the ability to restrict what materials individuals choose to put in their bodies is not on that list.  I presume that you would cite the commerce clause when trying to justify your actions. However, you know perfectly well that it is possible to produce and consume a substance without engaging in commerce or transporting it across state lines.  If one does this, I would admit that the federal government could have jurisdiction.  However, you are continuing to spend my money to imprison people who are not engaging in interstate commerce and merely possess restricted substances.  I don’t even think the states should be incarcerating people for nonviolent drug possession.  However, if someone is going to engage in such totalitarian activities, it should be state or local governments. The federal government absolutely no right to do any of this.</p>
<p>I further presume that you would defend your unconstitutional actions by claiming that the Constitution is not a static document, but a living one that must be read in the context of an ever-changing world. To that, I would say to look again at this <a href="http://www.mattgroff.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/13v15.gif">graph</a> that represents the reality of our ever-changing world.  Even if you twist the constitution into a pretzel to try to justify your actions over the last 4 years, the reality remains that these prohibitionist policies are not achieving their intended aims.</p>
<p>People with mental illness self-medicating themselves is the number one cause of illegal drug use. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreams_from_My_Father">Dreams From My Father</a>, you admitted that this was the reason you turned to drugs when you stated, &#8220;Pot had helped, and booze; maybe a little blow when you could afford it.&#8221;  The <a href="https://quantimo.do/">failure</a> of the mental health community to take a rigorous, data-centric approach to diagnosis and treatment is the reason that mental illness, and by extension illegal drug use is so pervasive in this country. If I had 0.1% of the $10 billion that you spend on law enforcement and incarceration, I could prevent more illegal drug use with my <a href="https://quantimo.do/">application</a> then you can with the entire $10 billion.</p>
<p>If you have any respect for democracy, you should at the very least end the federal prohibition of marijuana.  55% of Americans agree with me on this issue as is illustrated by this <a href="http://blogs.lawyers.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/MJ-Infographic.jpg">infographic</a>.</p>

<p>To be fair, I would like to thank you for the progress you have made in reducing drug possession sentencing disparities.  I appreciate your true and good intentions.  I know that you want to reduce suffering in the world.  However, I would still like to politely request that you request $0 for federal incarceration of nonviolent drug offenders, interdiction, and “international programs” in your next budget proposal to congress.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The mythology of effective <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynsianism">Keynesian</a> centralized economic planning is born of the same mother as the mythology of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creationism">creationist</a> intelligent design.  Both of these fantasies arise as a result of the human mind&#8217;s inability to deal with complex systems.</p>
<p>Evolution and economics are just two forms of a larger phenomenon called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_system">complex adaptive systems</a>, in which individual elements interact, process information and adapt their behavior to changing conditions. Immune systems, ecosystems, language, the law, and the Internet are other examples of complex adaptive systems.</p>
<p>Intuitively, it just seems impossible that millions of tiny economic actors just acting in their own interests could produce something as amazingly productive as the global economy.  Keynesians have a religious faith that our society’s unimaginable wealth must be a result of the conscious efforts of a top-down intelligent designer, the Federal Reserve, creating order in the chaos of the free market.</p>
<p>Just as creationists naturally deduce the existence of a top-down intelligent designer, Keynesians also infer that a top-down government designer is needed in nearly every aspect of the economy. However, in reality, complex living organisms are shaped from the bottom up by natural selection.  In the same way, our economy is molded from the bottom up by the invisible hand.</p>
<p>Businesses are formed by a confluence of random self-interested parties.  Those that happen to produce more value than they consume survive and proliferate.  Those that are not well suited for their business environment are removed from the commercial gene pool unless their presidential god intervenes.</p>
