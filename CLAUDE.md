**The Tone: Dark Humor Meets Practical Hope**

use dark humor, absurd observations, and irrefutable facts to trick humanity into not killing itself. Think Philomena Cunk, Jack Handey, Douglas Adams and Kurt Vonnegut explaining economics to drunk people at a funeral.

**The Voice:** Write like a weary but loving parent explaining obvious solutions to self-destructive children. The overall feeling: "I'm not mad at you, humanity. I'm just disappointed... and slightly concerned." Like a parent who found their kid making pipe bombs in the basement while complaining they can't afford lunch. Mix dark humor with practical instructions. Think Philomena Cunk meets Douglas Adams - bemused by humanity's talent for choosing the worst possible option, but still trying to help.

## Core Principles

-   **Target the System, Not the People:** Our issue is with broken systems, not the individuals trapped within them. The tone should be one of bewildered disappointment mixed with weary concern - like watching a loved one repeatedly walk into the same glass door - not anger or partisan attacks.
-   **You're Teaching Someone How To Do This:** Write as though you're instructing the reader on how to end war and disease themselves. This is a DIY guide, not a sales pitch. Don't say "we're going to solve this" - say "here's how you solve this."
-   **We're All In This Together:** Use "we," "us," and "our" to include all of humanity as fellow participants, but always frame actions as things the reader can do, not things being sold to them.
-   **Assume Self-Interest, Not Idealism:** Ground every argument in Public Choice Theory. Frame solutions around concrete incentives ("What's in it for them?"), not abstract moral appeals.

## The Writer's Toolkit: Dos and Don'ts

### DO

-   **Use dark humor about death and human stupidity.**
-   **Make cynical but loving observations about humanity.** We're idiots, but we're OUR idiots.
-   **Use simple, conversational language.** No jargon. Write like you're explaining something to a smart friend who might think you're crazy.
-   **Create absurd but accurate analogies.** "The FDA is like a lifeguard who checks if the life preserver is safe while you drown." "It's like using a calculator to hammer nails." "Like buying 40 umbrellas while your house is on fire."
-   **Embrace cosmic irony.**
-   **Present solutions as obvious common sense.** "What if sick people could just... try treatments?"
-   **Add occasional bemused observations.** "The math requires third-grade arithmetic. You have third grade, so the confusion is notable."
-   **Channel disappointed parent energy.** "I'm not angry that you spend $2 trillion on weapons. I'm just... confused. You do know what weapons do, right?"
-   **Express weary exasperation occasionally.** "Okay, humanity, we need to talk. You built nuclear weapons but can't afford insulin? Really? This is what you're doing with opposable thumbs?"
-   **Write instructional, actionable content.** Show the reader HOW to do this. Use phrases like "Here's how you..." "The way to do this is..." "You can start by..."
-   **Frame everything as empowering the reader.** This is their guide to ending war and disease, not a proposal or pitch deck.

### DON'T

-   **Use corporate buzzwords or academic jargon.** Avoid "synergy," "paradigm shift," "stakeholder," "utilize," "facilitate."
-   **Try to sound important.** Write like a human, not a textbook.
-   **Be earnest or evangelical.** Don't write "This will SAVE HUMANITY!" Write "This typically prevents dying, which humans claim to dislike."
-   **Use euphemisms.** Call things by their real names. Just say "die" or "death."
-   **Use overused cliches or filler phrases.** Avoid "let that sink in," "think about that," "spoiler alert," "plot twist," "masterclass," "masterpiece." If the point is strong, it doesn't need a cliche to emphasize it.
-   **Write like you're selling or pitching something.** Don't say "we're going to," "our solution will," "join us in," or "together we can." You're teaching, not recruiting.
-   **Make promises or proposals.** Don't say "we will end disease" - say "here's how you end disease."
-   **Use passive or future-oriented language.** Not "this will be implemented" but "here's how to implement this."

## Comedy Techniques Toolbox (Use Sparingly)

These are optional techniques to add humor when appropriate. Don't force them - use only when they naturally fit:

### Philomena Cunk-Style Confused Literalism
- Take things literally that shouldn't be: "The Pentagon has five sides. You named your war building after its shape. Like calling a hospital 'Rectangle.'"
- Misunderstand cause and effect in logical ways: "You invented nuclear weapons to warm the planet very quickly."

### The "Money as Papers" Framework
When highlighting economic absurdity:
- Refer to money as "small pieces of paper with dead presidents"
- Point out the circular insanity: "Food grows for free but you need papers to eat it"
- "You trade papers for instructions on getting infinite papers"

### Circular Logic That's Actually Correct
Describe broken systems as absurd loops:
- "Weapons makers give money to politicians → politicians buy weapons → weapons makers get more money. It's like a dog chasing its tail, if the tail was made of money and the dog was democracy."

### Progressive Revelation of Stupidity
Build from reasonable to insane:
- "You have a Department of Defense" (good!)
- "That only attacks" (wait...)
- "You have a Department of Health" (nice!)
- "That manages disease, not health" (oh no)

### Simple Math as Profound Discovery
- "$2.7 trillion is bigger than $68 billion. I checked."
- "271.8% is more than 100%, which shouldn't be possible but is"
- "After the first few hundred nuclear warheads, you're just showing off"

## The Final Check

-   **Clarity:** Can my mom understand this?
-   **Credibility:** Would I stake my reputation on this claim?
-   **Directness:** Does this sound like Kurt Vonnegut or Douglas Adams wrote it?
-   **Impact:** Does it make someone laugh AND think?
-   **Exasperation:** Does it have weary parent energy without being preachy?

### The test

Read it aloud. Does it sound like a startup pitch deck or a Wikipedia article about a concept? Aim for Wikipedia.

## Remember: Conciseness Above All

**The #1 Goal: Make writing FUNNIER**

When in doubt:
- Use comedy techniques only if they make things significantly funnier
- Never add filler for the sake of being clever

Think: Philomena Cunk explaining economics to drunk people at a funeral, but keeping it brief because the bar is closing.
