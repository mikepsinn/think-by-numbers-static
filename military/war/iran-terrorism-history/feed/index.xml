		<description><![CDATA[Hi D, all people see only a small part of the truth. It has been clearly shown that aggressive people tend to see less of it. We all have a problem that our psychology under threat or seeming threat becomes aggressive easily and thereby loses accuracy.

You might have to be more specific about which foreign policy you studied and what truth you see which others dont. Kissinger&#039;s approach of sabotaging the people you have decided are your opposition might sound clever to students but that doesnt change the facts or resultant dynamics: There is massive interference and aggression funded, supported, and committed by the US, initially to sabotage apparent opponents. but then leading to them having more enemies. the majority of the enemies America regards as dangerous were funded by them earlier to sabotage someone else, I assume you know this if you mixed history in with your policy studies. 

We know America is in danger, the problem is that its aggressive activities is escalating the danger it is in. By killing large amounts of civilians one creates terrorists faster than one can kill terrorists. When justifying aggression it is not easy to convince others you have a broader view than they. The academic consensus justifying all this violence in some parts of the USA and Europe is not proof of deeper insight, (neither, as you would probably agree, is the consensus in much of the rest of the world that it is counter productive). Very few large institutions are not affected the dynamics of power. Are we to believe Naom Chomsky didnt study foreign policy deeply? In the phyilosophy of science you&#039;ve probably picked up that we are currently disproving and replacing theories faster than at any time before. Textbooks get updated. Old ones are always out of date. Very few of us see the same truth as those around us see, neurologists have in the last decade shown our individual perceptions of the world are pretty unique. 

One&#039;s attitude determines what we filter out and latch onto to build our version of truth. Aggressive people easily build a consensus when they define common enemies. If you start with dangerous assumptions around cultural superiority you can easily denigrate the rights of others and turn a blind eye to the massive suffering that is created by overassertive unmanaged capitalism and imperialism. 

Is there an ideology that is so compelling that it justifies us ignoring facts, science, cost in suffering, and odds of success?
Regards

That&#039;s fine. Thanks for asking!  It would be cool if you could put a link back to my site at the top of it, though.

I like your site!
