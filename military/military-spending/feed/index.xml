		<description><![CDATA[I can just tell by the vocabulary you use that you are far more intelligent then me. Honestly though everything you have said on this webpage is exactly how I feel. I have always known there are other people out there that feel the same way as me, but still finding someone willing to speak out about it is something I am not accustomed to. I&#039;ll be honest when I say at first I figured your page was to good to be true and you were probably going to ask for a donation to some ridiculous fund or political party. But your doing a good thing with this page, and your ideas and the way you present information in an unbiased manner truly earn my respect. I know I&#039;m only one person but for what its worth great job man, it might even be a hopeless fight but when you look back at your life even if you can&#039;t change the system at least you can say to yourself I tried to help in the best way possible.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think I can help with that. I can suggest something about the problem of why &quot;we&quot; &quot;allow&quot; these things to go on. You need look no further than the Internet with its legions of zombie hosts and their &quot;bots&quot; that jam websites, harvest email addresses and passwords, send spam, transmit malware and provide any number of other services for their socially deviant owners. The human race is like that to a considerable extent -- legions of zombie bots, doing their leaders&#039; bidding. Which is to allow and empower what goes on.

So what are you going to do about that -- reason with the bots? Raise their awareness? I am afraid that there are vast hordes of humans out their that have little or no capacity to raise their awareness. With enough effort, you might get some number of them to SAY that they have raised their awareness, but being bots they would just be repeating what you wanted them to say. They can say anything, if you tell them what to say first. It might be possible to reprogram some of the bots. That could be interesting.

I am not saying that there is no way out of this. I am not saying that I know a way out of it either.]]></description>
