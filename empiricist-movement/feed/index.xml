		<description><![CDATA[Great points, Don!  

I  ride my bike almost everywhere, too!

What is the mechanism by which &quot;spending 25% of our purchases on American-made and manufactured products&quot; would reduce suffering?  It seems like we have a shortage of people going into service sector jobs like medical practitioners.  It already takes me like 3 months to get into see any kind of specialist.  I wouldn&#039;t want to pull more people out of the service sector and into the manufacturing sector.



What do you think?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike, I fully embrace your desire for empiricist thinking as a means for solving political problems. If we move to a utilitarian way of thinking, and our government acts rationally instead of with blind passion, then we all benefit. 

       However, there&#039;s still a missing piece of the puzzle here. The more I see ideological blog wars and political stalemates, the more I  realize that personal responsibility is missing on all accounts. How do rational thoughts become action? Must we rely on positive change in the government to effect positive change in the world?

       In terms of the US economy, I would suggest that the most utilitarian action we can undertake at this point is to actually make a commitment to spending 25% of our purchases on American-made and manufactured products--notice the 25%, I&#039;m not advocating nationalism.  If every American did that, there would be a much simpler discussion on national debt (because of the vastly increased work force). 

        I would suggest that the most utilitarian action I can undertake concerning the environment is to do 80% of my commuting on my bicycle (which I&#039;ve been doing for almost three years). Or  we can buy only local food, an action that benefits our world on a number of levels.  

       We can go on and on in this fashion. Those of us in the middle class have the power to change things starting today. I think your charts are valuable, but we can&#039;t stop there. What we do in the next 24 hours is the ultimate test of our  utilitarian values.]]></description>
