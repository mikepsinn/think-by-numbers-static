# Vote!

## Voting for Comments

The site encourages users to employ the comments voting system by:

1. **Upvoting comments** that contain factual information with proper sources
2. **Downvoting ad hominem attacks** directed at anyone

Name-calling is completely unproductive. Personal attacks cause emotional responses to override rational thinking, making primates out of philosophers.

## Voting for Politicians

Should you vote in elections? Two perspectives:

### The Self-Interested Answer: No

Statistical evidence shows your individual vote has less than a 0.00001% chance of determining a national election outcome. By comparison, you face a 0.002% likelihood of injury driving to the polls. Therefore, from a practical standpoint focused on personal welfare, staying home is more rational.

### The Civic-Minded Answer: Yes

However, if you possess genuine knowledge about candidates' abilities to reduce suffering, you should vote. This motivation is "irrational" but frames it as fulfilling civic duty. The best candidate likely won't be on the ballot or will run third-party.
