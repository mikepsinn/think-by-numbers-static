The FDA revoked monoclonal antibodies because they became "less effective" against new variants. Not ineffective. Less effective.

Your regulatory agency can't distinguish between 30% efficacy and 0% efficacy. The math requires third-grade arithmetic, which you have, so the confusion is notable.

Here's the calculation they skipped:

## 1. "Less Effective" ≠ "Ineffective"

**What happened:**
- mAbs went from 85% efficacy to 30% efficacy against new variants
- FDA response: Ban them entirely

**What this means:**
- 100,000 high-risk patients
- 30% reduction = 30,000 fewer hospitalizations
- At $20,000 per hospitalization = $600 million saved
- Plus the lives not lost, which humans claim to value

**For comparison:**
- Flu vaccines: 40-60% efficacy (FDA approved)
- mAbs at 30%: Banned

You approved the less effective treatment. The math is third grade.

## 2. The $3.7 Trillion Bill Nobody Calculated

Long COVID affects 10-30% of infections. That's millions of people with persistent symptoms, reduced productivity, and ongoing medical costs.

**Total projected cost:** $3.7 trillion to the U.S. economy ([Harvard Kennedy School](https://jheor.org/doi/full/10.5195/jheor.2023.1189))

**If mAbs prevented just 5% of Long COVID cases:**
- 185,000 fewer cases per million infections
- $370 billion saved

The FDA chose not to run this calculation before revoking access.

## 3. The Monitoring System That Doesn't Exist

**Systems the FDA already operates:**
- VAERS: Tracks vaccine side effects in real-time
- Sentinel System: Monitors drug safety for millions of patients
- Cost: Already built, already running

**System the FDA could have built for mAbs:**
- Real-time outcome tracking
- Public dashboard showing efficacy by variant
- Cost: $10-20 million annually

Instead, they guessed mAbs didn't work and stopped tracking outcomes. It's like closing your eyes to check if it's dark.

## 4. Who This Killed

**Immunocompromised patients (3% of U.S. population):**
- Vaccines don't work for them
- mAbs were their only protection
- FDA revoked access anyway ([CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-considerations/covid-19-immunocompromised-patients.html))

**Rural and low-income populations:**
- Limited access to advanced care
- mAbs were often their only treatment option
- FDA removed it

**Meanwhile:** Private clinics kept stockpiles for those who could pay. The FDA created a two-tier system by accident.

## 5. The Risk Math They Skipped

**Risk of mAb infusion reactions:** 0.2% ([JAMA](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2777081))

**Risk of hospitalization/death for high-risk COVID patients without treatment:** 10-20% ([Yale Medicine](https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/paxlovid-is-beneficial-for-high-risk-acute-covid-19-patients-study-suggests))

You banned a treatment with 0.2% risk to prevent a disease with 10-20% risk of severe outcomes. This is like banning seatbelts because the buckle might pinch.

## 6. Options They Ignored

**What the FDA could have done:**
- Compassionate use pathway for high-risk patients
- Combination therapy (mAbs + antivirals)
- Fast-track next-generation mAbs
- Track real-world outcomes with existing systems
- Public dashboard for transparency

**What the FDA did:**
- Revoked access
- Stopped monitoring
- Provided no alternatives

## How to Fix This

1. **Allow investigational use** with informed consent for treatments showing partial efficacy
2. **Deploy real-time monitoring** using systems that already exist ($10-20M annually)
3. **Compare costs** of treatment vs. doing nothing before making decisions
4. **Track outcomes** instead of guessing

The FDA had the data, the infrastructure, and the budget. They chose bureaucratic neatness over preventing a $3.7 trillion economic catastrophe.

This wasn't a judgment call. It was institutional failure to do basic arithmetic.
