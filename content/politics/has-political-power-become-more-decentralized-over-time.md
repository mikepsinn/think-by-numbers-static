    The post effectively uses public choice logic to demonstrate that
    decentralizing power reduces the most extreme form of human capital
    destruction: democide. While it correctly identifies that moving from
    autocracy to democracy is a net gain for median survival, it acknowledges
    that democracy remains a low bar for societal optimization, failing to
    address the subtler forms of wealth extraction and regulatory capture
    prevalent in modern representative systems.

Over the last 60 years, democracies doubled. Autocracies got cut in half.

The world currently has 58 democracies and 13 autocracies.

That's progress. You can tell because there are fewer countries where one person decides if you die.

The chart shows the math. Democracy means spreading power among many humans instead of concentrating it in one human who typically makes poor decisions about other humans' continued existence.

This doesn't mean democracies are good at decision-making. They're just measurably less likely to kill their own citizens than autocracies. The bar is underground, yet humanity keeps celebrating when it clears it.
