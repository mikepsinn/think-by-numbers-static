description: >-
  FDA restricted what 23andMe tells you about your DNA. Takes doctors 17 years
  to use new genetic research. Free tools interpret your data now.

    This post identifies a textbook case of regulatory capture and paternalism
    where the FDA restricts individual access to private information. By
    highlighting the 17-year institutional lag in medical research adoption, it
    exposes a massive systemic inefficiency. Providing decentralized, free tools
    to bypass these state-enforced bottlenecks empowers individuals to optimize
    their own human capital (health) and reduces the deadweight loss caused by
    information asymmetry and rent-seeking intermediaries.

You paid 23andMe for your genetic data. The FDA then [restricted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/23andMe#FDA) what 23andMe can tell you about your own DNA. It's like buying a book and having the government black out most of the pages to protect you from dangerous information about yourself.

Thousands of research papers get published each month linking genetic variants to diseases and treatments. It takes doctors an average of [17 years](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3241518/) to start using this research. That's 17 years of unnecessary suffering because someone decided the best way to help sick people is to make them wait nearly two decades.

Here's how to interpret your own genetic data without waiting for permission.

## Free Interpretation Tools

### codegen.eu

The best free option. Upload your 23andMe data and get:

- Links between your genes and over 2000 diseases
- Nutrition and fitness information specific to your DNA
- Drug and disease associations
- Machine learning that figures out which variants actually matter

### Genetic Genie

[Genetic Genie](http://geneticgenie.org/) analyzes methylation and detox pathways. Free, which is good, because paying to understand your own genes is like paying twice for the same sandwich.

### Enlis Genomics Personal Edition

[Enlis Genomics Personal Edition](https://www.enlis.com/personal_edition.html) shows how your genetic variants affect gene function and links to relevant research papers. It's like 23andMe but with the pages unblacked-out.

### Genomelink

[Genomelink](http://genomelink.io) tells you traits you already know by virtue of existing. "You have brown eyes." Yes, I have mirrors.

## Not So Free Interpretation

### Sequencing.com

[Sequencing.com](http://Sequencing.com) is a genetic app store with paid apps and some free ones. Many of the promoted free apps don't actually exist, which is like advertising a sale on invisible products.

## Any suggestions?
