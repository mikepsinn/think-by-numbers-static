    This content exposes a systemic 'health extraction' mechanism: the
    replacement of nutrient-dense whole foods with subsidized, pro-inflammatory
    industrial seed oils. By linking the 'Kynurenine Shunt' (inflammation
    diverting tryptophan from serotonin production) to dietary shifts, it
    provides a biological explanation for the mental health crisis. If widely
    understood, it shifts the solution from lifelong pharmaceutical dependency
    (treating symptoms) to dietary intervention (addressing the root cause),
    representing a massive potential increase in median health and happiness.

The US suicide rate jumped 40% over the last 20 years. Turns out when you replace vegetables with fried oil and your immune system with constant inflammation, your brain stops making the chemicals that prevent you from wanting to die. The math is third-grade level. The confusion is notable.

Around the year 2000, Americans decided to conduct a massive uncontrolled experiment: What happens if we deep-fry everything in inflammatory oils while simultaneously stopping the consumption of things that grow from the ground?

Vegetable oil consumption went up. Vegetable oil is the thing you use to fry foods, not an actual vegetable. The naming is like calling cigarettes "lung enhancers."

Meanwhile, actual vegetable consumption dropped 10%. Things that grow from dirt and reduce inflammation? Apparently less appealing than deep-fried trans fats.

Fruit intake fell 25%. Fruit also reduces inflammation, which explains why humans stopped eating it.

Autoimmune disorders have been climbing for decades. Your immune system, which evolved to fight infections, now spends its time attacking your own organs. Evolution did not prepare it for this much fried oil.

People with autoimmune diseases are significantly more likely to have depression. People with depression are significantly more likely to have autoimmune diseases. It's almost as if they're the same thing.

When your immune system freaks out from constant inflammation, it steals tryptophan from your brain. Tryptophan is what your body uses to make serotonin and melatonin - the chemicals that make you not want to die and help you sleep. Remove those chemicals and you get what doctors call "depression" and what your body calls "appropriate response to being poisoned."

The inflammatory diet triggers permanent sickness behavior in millions of people. We then give them antidepressants instead of vegetables. It's like treating a broken leg with positive thinking.
