# I Am Biased

## Political Labels = Intellectual Prisons

I acknowledge accepting various political descriptors but prefer identifying as a utilitarian. I argue that voters basing their political decisions on statistics instead of emotion will facilitate the minimization of suffering in the world.

While some of my views may align with libertarian perspectives—particularly skepticism toward concentrated power—I resist categorical labeling. Political classifications ultimately serve divisive purposes, despite the fact that people across the spectrum share a common aspiration: addressing humanity's greatest challenges.

The core argument is that meaningful progress requires moving beyond partisan frameworks toward evidence-based policymaking focused on reducing suffering globally.
