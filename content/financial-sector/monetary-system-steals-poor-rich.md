    This content addresses the 'Cantillon Effect'—the mechanism where those
    closest to the money creation source (banks and government) benefit from new
    capital before it devalues the currency in the broader economy. In an era of
    record-high sovereign debt and persistent inflation, understanding that
    inflation is a regressive tax on labor and a subsidy for asset holders is
    the most critical step for the median individual to protect their wealth. It
    exposes the core engine of modern wealth inequality.
