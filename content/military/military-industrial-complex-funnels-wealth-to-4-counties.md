    The core observation—that the concentration of federal 'defense' spending
    creates a localized wealth bubble at the expense of the rest of the
    nation—is a profound example of wealth extraction. However, the reasoning in
    the text relies on satirical filler (geometry, circles vs. squares) rather
    than explaining the actual mechanisms of lobbying, revolving doors, and
    cost-plus contracting. It identifies the 'where' but fails to rigorously
    explain the 'how,' which limits its power to drive policy change.

The four richest counties in America all surround the Pentagon. This is either a remarkable coincidence or weapons are very profitable. I checked the math.

The Pentagon is a building shaped like five sides. This is called a "pentagon." When you have five sides, money flows to the four counties surrounding you. I'm not sure why the fifth side doesn't get a county, but that's geometry for you.

## The Winners

1. Loudoun County, VA
2. Falls Church, VA
3. Fairfax County, VA
4. Howard County, MD

All four counties cluster around Washington D.C., specifically around the building where we decide how to spend military money. It's like a watering hole, if water was government contracts and the animals were defense contractors in suits.

Maybe the reason these counties are so rich is because they're geographically close to money. Like, the money can't travel very far, so it just stays nearby. That would explain why counties in Ohio aren't as rich - they're too far from the Pentagon for the money to reach them.

## How The System Works

Here's the simple version:

1. Defense contractors give money to politicians
2. Politicians buy weapons
3. Defense contractors get more money
4. Defense contractors give more to politicians

It's a circle. A very profitable circle. For four counties.

Circles are round. This is important because if the system was a square, it would have corners where money could get stuck. But circles have no corners, so the money just keeps flowing forever. That's why we call it a "cycle" and not a "square."

President Eisenhower warned about this in 1961. He ran the military during World War II, so his confusion about peacetime military spending is notable.

Eisenhower's Warning about the Military-Industrial Complex

## The Lobbying Math

Defense contractors spend millions lobbying Congress. Congress then allocates billions to defense contractors. The return on investment is excellent.

## The Revolving Door

Many government officials leave to work for defense contractors. Many defense contractor executives become government officials. They're not changing jobs. They're changing seats at the same table.

A revolving door is a type of door that spins in a circle. When you walk through it, you end up on the other side, but the door keeps spinning. If you wanted to, you could just keep walking through it over and over again. I think that's what government officials are doing, except instead of just walking, they're collecting millions of dollars each time they go around.

This creates what economists call "conflicts of interest" and what everyone else calls "obviously corrupt."

## What You Can Do

Track defense contractor lobbying:
- Check [OpenSecrets.org](https://www.opensecrets.org/) for lobbying data
- Search which contractors donate to your representatives
- Note the correlation between donations and contract awards

Follow the revolving door:
- Search "[government official name] + defense contractor" to see career paths
- Track which officials move to which companies
- Notice the pattern

Contact your representatives:
- Ask specific questions about specific contracts
- Reference actual dollar amounts
- Request justification for contract awards to companies that employ former officials

The pattern is clear. The solution is simpler: Stop rewarding it.
