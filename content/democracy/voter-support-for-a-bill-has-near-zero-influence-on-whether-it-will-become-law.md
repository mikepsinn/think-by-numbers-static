Professors Martin Gilens and Benjamin Page analyzed over two decades of data to answer a fundamental question: **Does the government represent the people?**

After examining nearly 2,000 public opinion surveys and comparing them to actual policy outcomes, they discovered that the opinions of [90% of Americans have virtually no impact on legislation](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B/S1537592714001595a.pdf/testing_theories_of_american_politics_elites_interest_groups_and_average_citizens.pdf).

In a representative democracy, the more people like a bill, the more likely it would be to become law.

However, in reality, public support has almost no influence on what laws are passed. Whether there is [0% or 100%](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B/S1537592714001595a.pdf/testing_theories_of_american_politics_elites_interest_groups_and_average_citizens.pdfhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B/S1537592714001595a.pdf/testing_theories_of_american_politics_elites_interest_groups_and_average_citizens.pdf) support for a policy, there’s a [30% likelihood](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B/S1537592714001595a.pdf/testing_theories_of_american_politics_elites_interest_groups_and_average_citizens.pdf) that it will become law.
