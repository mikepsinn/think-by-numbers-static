The average American pays [$10,489](https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&id=4763) in “personal taxes,” representing [14%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States) of the average household’s total income.

This [$10,489](https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&id=4763) includes:

-   federal income taxes
-   state income taxes
-   personal property taxes
-   vehicle taxes
-   other small taxes

However, the entire US Federal Budget alone is [$4.4 trillion](https://www.thebalance.com/u-s-federal-budget-breakdown-3305789) and the US population is [328,316,410](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/us-population/).
