The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) handling over 150 million individual tax returns annually faces significant challenges in efficiency and cost-effectiveness. This article examines the potential economic benefits of the IRS implementing a TurboTax-like website with automated features, including pre-filling forms with available data.

## Current Costs of Tax Compliance

1.  Time Costs:
    
    -   Average time spent on tax preparation: 13 hours per taxpayer
    -   Total time cost: Approximately 1.95 billion hours annually
    -   Monetary value: $210 billion (based on average hourly earnings)
2.  Out-of-Pocket Costs:
    
    -   Average cost for basic 1040 preparation: $176
    -   Total out-of-pocket costs: $31 billion annually
3.  IRS Operational Costs:
    
    -   FY 2022 IRS budget: $12.6 billion
4.  Economic Inefficiency:
    
    -   Estimated cost due to tax-induced behavioral changes: $400 billion annually

Total Direct and Indirect Costs: Over $650 billion annually

## Potential Benefits of Automated IRS Filing System

1.  Time Savings:
    
    -   Estimated reduction in preparation time: 50-70%
    -   Potential time saved: 975 million to 1.37 billion hours annually
    -   Monetary value of time saved: $105-147 billion
2.  Out-of-Pocket Savings:
    
    -   Potential reduction in tax preparation costs: 80-90%
    -   Estimated savings: $24.8-27.9 billion annually
3.  Improved Accuracy:
    
    -   Current net tax gap (difference between taxes owed and collected): $380 billion (2013-2015 average)
    -   Potential reduction in tax gap: 10-20%
    -   Additional tax revenue: $38-76 billion annually
4.  IRS Operational Efficiency:
    
    -   Potential reduction in IRS processing costs: 30-40%
    -   Estimated savings: $3.8-5.0 billion annually
5.  Economic Efficiency Gains:
    
    -   Potential reduction in tax-induced economic distortions: 5-10%
    -   Estimated economic benefit: $20-40 billion annually

## Implementation Costs and Considerations

1.  Development Costs:
    
    -   Estimated initial development cost: $50-100 million
    -   Annual maintenance and updates: $10-20 million
2.  Data Security:
    
    -   Enhanced cybersecurity measures: $50-100 million initially, $10-20 million annually
3.  Public Education and Outreach:
    
    -   Initial campaign: $100-200 million
    -   Ongoing education: $20-50 million annually
4.  Transition Period:
    
    -   Gradual adoption over 3-5 years
    -   Parallel operation of old and new systems during transition

## Net Economic Benefit

Conservative Estimate:

-   Total Annual Benefits: $191.6 billion
-   Total Annual Costs: $40-90 million
-   Net Annual Benefit: Approximately $191.5 billion

Optimistic Estimate:

-   Total Annual Benefits: $295.9 billion
-   Total Annual Costs: $40-90 million
-   Net Annual Benefit: Approximately $295.8 billion

## Conclusion

Implementing an automated, TurboTax-like system by the IRS could potentially yield net economic benefits of $191-296 billion annually. This represents a significant return on investment, with benefits far outweighing implementation and operational costs. However, successful implementation would require careful planning, robust security measures, and a comprehensive public education campaign.
