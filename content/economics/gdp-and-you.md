  World GDP is $127.8 trillion divided by 7.3 billion people equals $17,500
  each. Happiness maxes out at $75k income. Above that you're just buying stuff,
  not joy. Economics with spreadsheets.

GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product, which sounds medical but isn't. It's the [value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value "Market value") of all final goods and services produced within a country. The "gross" part means it hasn't been cleaned yet.

If you ever drop your GDP into a river of molten lava, let it go, because man, it's gone.

The reason GDP matters is that it is directly correlated to a reduction in human suffering. Economic growth is the primary differentiating factor between a life lived in the US and a life lived in North Korea. It's also the primary differentiating factor between a life lived in the 11th century (when your biggest concern was the Black Death) and the 21st century (when your biggest concern is whether your phone charger will reach your bed).

Economic growth has cured countless diseases which would have otherwise imbued countless lives with unimaginable suffering. Economic growth has prevented billions from dying of starvation. If governments will get out of its way, economic growth will eventually eliminate human suffering from the planet. It's like magic, but with spreadsheets.

According to the most recent [income/happiness study](http://content.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,2016291,00.html), the lower a person's annual income falls below $75,000 a year, the unhappier he or she feels. But no matter how much more than $75,000 people make, they don't report any greater degree of happiness. This raises the profound question: Can you buy happiness? Answer: Yes, but only up to $75,000 worth. After that you're just buying stuff.

The strong correlation between happiness and GDP is illustrated below.

[Filip Spagnoli](http://web.archive.org/web/20140303030542/http://filipspagnoli.tumblr.com/) identifies an array of positive and negative correlations between per capita GDP and the following metrics. I wonder if he's related to spaghetti?
