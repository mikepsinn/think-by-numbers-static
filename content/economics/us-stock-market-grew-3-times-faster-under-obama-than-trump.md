![US Stock Market Grew 3 Times Faster Under Obama Than Trump](/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/us-stock-market-returns-under-trump-obama-480x325.png)

First two years of Trump: stocks up 21%. First two years of Obama: stocks up 71.2%. That's 3.4 times faster. I checked the math on my fingers and toes, and it still came out that way.

Obama did start after a market crash, which helps. It's easier to grow when you're starting from the bottom. It's like how it's easier to clean your room when it's already on fire—anywhere you go from there is technically an improvement.

But Trump's 21% gain is just the 50-year average (10.5% per year). Nothing special. Just average. Like getting a participation trophy for existing. Which, to be fair, is pretty much what the stock market gives you if you just hold index funds and don't panic-sell every time CNBC screams about something.
