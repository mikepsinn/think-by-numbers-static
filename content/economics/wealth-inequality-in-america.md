  Americans underestimate wealth inequality so badly the perception gap exceeds
  the actual wealth gap—like thinking your neighbor has 2 cars when they own a
  dealership.

    This content addresses a fundamental psychological barrier to policy reform:
    the 'Perception Gap.' By exposing that the actual distribution of wealth is
    significantly more extreme than what the average citizen even perceives as
    'unfair,' it removes the veil of normalization that protects extractive
    policies. While the specific study referenced (Norton/Ariely) is roughly a
    decade old, the mechanism—wealth concentration occurring faster than public
    awareness can track it—is an evergreen principle of power. It is highly
    relevant today because the gap has only widened since the video's release,
    making the psychological 'anchoring' effect even more dangerous to the
    median person's financial health.

Americans were asked to estimate wealth distribution. Then they were shown the actual numbers. The gap between perception and reality was larger than the wealth gap itself. Which is saying something, because the wealth gap is roughly the size of the Grand Canyon.

It's like if you thought your neighbor had two cars, but it turns out they have a dealership.

Watch what happens when you show people the math. Spoiler alert: They get sad.
