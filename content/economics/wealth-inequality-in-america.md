  Americans underestimate wealth inequality so badly the perception gap exceeds
  the actual wealth gap—like thinking your neighbor has 2 cars when they own a
  dealership.

    While the 'perception gap' is a powerful psychological concept, this
    specific content relies on a viral video from 2012 and data from a 2011
    study. Under the provided constraints, dated statistics are capped at 5/10.
    Furthermore, it identifies a symptom (inequality) rather than exposing a
    specific, actionable policy mechanism currently extracting wealth, making it
    more descriptive than investigative for a modern context.

Americans were asked to estimate wealth distribution. Then they were shown the actual numbers. The gap between perception and reality was larger than the wealth gap itself. Which is saying something, because the wealth gap is roughly the size of the Grand Canyon.

It's like if you thought your neighbor had two cars, but it turns out they have a dealership.

Watch what happens when you show people the math. Spoiler alert: They get sad.
