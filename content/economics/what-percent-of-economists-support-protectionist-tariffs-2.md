  Reuters polled 60 economists about steel tariffs. 0% supported them. Zero as
  in number before one. Like asking 60 doctors if you should eat broken glass
  and getting zero yes votes.

    The content is based on a poll from March 2018. Per the instructions, stats
    older than 5 years are capped at 5/10, and policies/politicians older than 5
    years are capped at 4/10. However, the value remains relevant because
    protectionist tariffs are currently a central pillar of 2024 campaign
    platforms. The 0% consensus effectively exposes a mechanism of wealth
    extraction where median consumers pay higher prices to subsidize specific
    industries, making it a powerful rhetorical tool for current electoral
    cycles.

Reuters polled 60 economists in March 2018 about steel and aluminum tariffs. The percent who supported them: 0%. That's zero as in the number that comes before one. Zero as in the amount of unicorns in your garage.

Not "almost zero." Zero. As in the number that comes before one. 80% said tariffs would harm the economy. The other 20% said they'd do nothing. Nobody said they'd help. It's like asking 60 doctors if you should eat broken glass and having zero of them say yes.

When literally zero economists support your economic policy, that's not a difference of opinion. That's just being wrong. It's like insisting that water flows uphill or that the Earth is shaped like a Dorito.
