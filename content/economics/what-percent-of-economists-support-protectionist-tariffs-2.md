In a poll by Reuters March 5-13, 0% of economists expressed support for tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.

Nearly 80 percent of 60 economists who answered a question on the tariffs said they would do more harm than good and the rest said it would do nothing or very little. Not one respondent said they would benefit the US economy.
