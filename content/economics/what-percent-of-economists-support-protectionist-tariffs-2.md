  Reuters polled 60 economists about steel tariffs. 0% supported them. Zero as
  in number before one. Like asking 60 doctors if you should eat broken glass
  and getting zero yes votes.

    This content exposes a massive 'Expert-Policy Gap.' Protectionist tariffs
    are a textbook example of concentrated benefits (helping a few visible
    industries) vs. dispersed costs (quietly extracting wealth from the median
    consumer via higher prices). While the specific poll is from 2018, the topic
    is extremely relevant today as global trade policy shifts toward increased
    protectionism, which functions as a hidden tax on the general population's
    purchasing power.

Reuters polled 60 economists in March 2018 about steel and aluminum tariffs. The percent who supported them: 0%. That's zero as in the number that comes before one. Zero as in the amount of unicorns in your garage.

Not "almost zero." Zero. As in the number that comes before one. 80% said tariffs would harm the economy. The other 20% said they'd do nothing. Nobody said they'd help. It's like asking 60 doctors if you should eat broken glass and having zero of them say yes.

When literally zero economists support your economic policy, that's not a difference of opinion. That's just being wrong. It's like insisting that water flows uphill or that the Earth is shaped like a Dorito.
