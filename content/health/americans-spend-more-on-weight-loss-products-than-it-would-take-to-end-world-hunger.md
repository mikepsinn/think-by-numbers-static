Americans spend more than [$60 billion](https://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/articles/2013/01/02/the-heavy-price-of-losing-weight) annually to try to lose weight, on everything from paying for gym memberships and joining weight-loss programs to drinking diet soda.

Resolving the global food crisis would cost [$30 billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/04/news/04iht-04food.13446176.html) a year according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.
