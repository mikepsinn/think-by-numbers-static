    This content exposes the 'Attention Extraction' policy of modern media. By
    quantifying the opportunity cost—25 full days per year—it highlights a
    massive drain on human capital. Reclaiming 600 hours annually from
    'unsolvable' global anxiety and reallocating it to local action,
    skill-building (wealth), or exercise (health) would fundamentally shift the
    median quality of life. While the data sources are slightly dated
    (2010/2018), the principle is more relevant now than ever due to the
    algorithmic amplification of 'doomscrolling'.

American adults spend [11 hours per day](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/people-are-pending-most-of-their-waking-hours-staring-at-screens-2018-08-01) staring at screens. That's more time than you spend sleeping, which seems backwards for a species that claims to value consciousness.

Of those 11 hours, about 70 minutes goes to consuming news. That's over an hour daily learning about problems you can't solve, in places you'll never visit, involving people you'll never meet. It's like a very depressing hobby.

Let's do the math, because apparently we need to:

- 70 minutes per day
- 7 days per week
- 52 weeks per year
- Equals roughly **608 hours per year** watching the world end in real time

That's 25 full days. You spend an entire month of your life, annually, consuming news. The news hasn't gotten noticeably better, but you keep watching. I'm not judging. I'm just... confused.
