[15%](http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/august_2011/voters_see_these_corporate_welfare_programs_as_a_good_place_to_cut_government_spending) of likely U.S. voters think the federal government should continue to provide [funding for foreign countries](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0745642411/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0745642411&linkCode=as2&tag=quant08-20) to buy military weapons from U.S. companies. Seventy percent ([70%](http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/august_2011/voters_see_these_corporate_welfare_programs_as_a_good_place_to_cut_government_spending)) oppose this funding to promote U.S. arms sales. Fifteen percent ([15%](http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/august_2011/voters_see_these_corporate_welfare_programs_as_a_good_place_to_cut_government_spending)) are undecided about it.  (To see survey question wording, [click here](http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/questions/pt_survey_questions/august_2011/questions_corporate_welfare_august_11_12_2011).)

Voters are more closely divided on the topic of [farm subsidies](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005ZH34ZQ/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B005ZH34ZQ&linkCode=as2&tag=quant08-20). The U.S. government typically provides more than [$20 billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_subsidy) a year in crop and farm subsidies, and 37% of voters feel those subsidies should continue. But a plurality (46%) thinks those subsidies should be ended, while 17% more are not sure.

Similarly, the federal government’s [Export-Import bank](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521104661/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0521104661&linkCode=as2&tag=quant08-20) provides billions of dollars in loans and loan guarantees to companies like Boeing and General Electric. The stated purpose is to sustain American jobs by financing U.S. exports.  But just [29%](https://www.downsizinggovernment.org/search-results?cx=006606822365722333854%3Afgcvw6tf0fw&cof=FORID%3A10&ie=UTF-8&query=voters%20don%20t%20support%20corporate%20welfare&sa=Search) of voters believe the government should continue to provide loans and loan guarantees to help finance export sales for large corporations. Again, a plurality of 46% opposes loans and loan guarantees for this purpose. Twenty-five percent ([25%](https://www.downsizinggovernment.org/search-results?cx=006606822365722333854%3Afgcvw6tf0fw&cof=FORID%3A10&ie=UTF-8&query=voters%20don%20t%20support%20corporate%20welfare&sa=Search)) are undecided.
