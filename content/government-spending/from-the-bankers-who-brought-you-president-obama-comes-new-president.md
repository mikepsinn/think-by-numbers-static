## 2013 Budget Plans

#### New Look! Same Great Waste!

Obama’s 2013 budget is [$3.80 Trillion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_United_States_federal_budget). Romney’s will be $3.79 trillion.

Budget Changes Specified by Candidate Romney™:

1.  Eliminate Obamacare (which is ironically very similar to Romneycare aside from the fact that Romneycare also covered abortions) – Estimated Savings = [$122](http://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=http://www.forbes.com/sites/aroy/2012/07/27/cbo-obamacare-will-spend-more-tax-more-and-reduce-the-deficit-less-than-we-previously-thought/&refURL=http://thinkbynumbers.org&referrer=http://thinkbynumbers.org) billion annually
2.  Increase Military Spending – Estimated Cost = [$45](https://myaccount.nytimes.com/auth/login?URI=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2011%2F11%2F07%2Fworld%2Fpanetta-weighs-military-cuts-once-thought-out-of-bounds.html%3F_r%3D5&REFUSE_COOKIE_ERROR=SHOW_ERROR) billion annually
3.  Increase Medicare Spending – Estimated Cost = [$71](http://www.factcheck.org/2012/08/a-campaign-full-of-mediscare/) billion annually
4.  “Deep Reductions” in funding for the National Endowment for the Arts – Estimated Savings = [$0.15](https://www.philanthropy.com/article/Arts-Spending-Cut-as-2012/195421) billion annually
5.  Eliminate Amtrak Subsidies – Estimated Savings = [$1.6](http://reason.com/archives/2011/11/09/absolutely-profligate) billion annually
6.  Eliminate Title X Family Planning Programs – Estimated Savings = [$0.3](http://khn.org/news/planned-parenthood-title-10/) billion annually

Add it up.  Romney’s Total Savings = $0.01 trillion less than Obama’s budget! With a national debt on the order of [$16.2](http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/debt/current) trillion, you’ll barely even notice the difference!

## Past Spending Records

##### Are you tired of all that money cluttering up your home?  Try NEW PRESIDENT™!

Governor Romney™ has been scientifically proven to increase spending faster than the President Obama™! Obama has only increased government spending a disappointing [5.5%](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/the-facts-about-the-growth-of-spending-under-obama/2012/05/24/gJQAIJh6nU_blog.html) annually over his term.

Under Governor Romney, Massachusetts state spending went from $22.3 billion to $28.1 billion,  an amazing [6.5%](https://myaccount.nytimes.com/auth/login?URI=http%3A%2F%2Fthecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com%2F2007%2F12%2F31%2Fclarification-on-huckabee-and-romney-spending%2F%3F_r%3D5&REFUSE_COOKIE_ERROR=SHOW_ERROR) per year! That’s faster than most other leading governors (6.2%)! And if we’ve learned anything from the vast disparity between George W. Bush’s fiscal rhetoric and [fiscal record](https://www.mercatus.org/publication/spending-under-president-george-w-bush), it’s that Romney’s gubernatorial record might be a better indicator of what we could expect from a Romney federal budget.

## Campaign Contributors

#### The Wall Street bankers that brought you President Obama™ love NEW PRESIDENT™!

The same [Wall Street recipients of TARP](http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2009/02/tarp-recipients-paid-out-114-m/) bailout money that [were top Obama donors](http://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/contrib.php?cycle=2008&amp;cid=N00009638) in 2008 [are top Romney donors](http://www.opensecrets.org/pres12/contrib.php?cycle=2012&amp;id=N00000286) in 2012. Why?

### Just like the Original President, New President

2.  Opposes immediately [balancing the federal budget](http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/there-is-not-going-to-be-a-solution-to-our-economic-problems-on-the-national-level).
3.  Has [a track record](http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/16-reasons-why-mitt-romney-would-be-a-really-really-bad-president) of being [a big spender](http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/17-reasons-why-a-vote-for-mitt-romney-is-a-vote-for-the-new-world-order) and a big-government advocate while in office.
4.  [Opposes](http://www.thepoliticalguide.com/Profiles/Governor/Massachusetts/Mitt_Romney/Views/The_Federal_Reserve/) a full audit of the Federal Reserve.
5.  Supports [taxpayer-funded bailouts](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/02/17/1065790/-Mitt-Romney-s-bailout-problem) of corporations.
6.  Wants to keep personal [income tax](https://turbotax.intuit.com/) rates [at the exact same levels](http://www.businessinsider.com/mitt-romney-tax-rates-low-2012-7) for the vast majority of Americans.
7.  Will increase [defense spending](http://www.rawstory.com/2011/02/defense-enjoys-short-term-boost-under-obama-budget/)
8.  Believes the President can take the country to [war](http://crooksandliars.com/nicole-belle/romney-president-has-power-act-unilat) without approval from Congress.
