## The Math

The entire US Federal Budget is $4.4 trillion. The US population is 328,316,410.

Divide $4.4 trillion by 328 million people and you get $13,401 in federal spending per American.

State governments spend $1.87 trillion, which equals $5,695 per person.

Local governments spend $1.99 trillion, which equals $6,061 per person.

Add it all up: **$25,280 in total government spending per person.**

That's more than most people spend on a used car, which is interesting because the government also can't pass an emissions test and makes weird noises when you try to turn it off.

## The Part Where It Gets Interesting

There are 328 million Americans but only 239 million are voting age. Even fewer actually vote.

Here's what government spending looks like when you divide by people who actually participate in democracy:

<table class="wp-block-table aligncenter is-style-stripes"><tbody><tr><td>Level</td><td>Government<br>Spending<br>Per Voting<br>Age Person</td><td>Spending<br>Per<br>Capita</td><td>Spending<br>Per Actual<br>Turned-Out<br>Voter</td></tr><tr><td>Federal</td><td>$18,704</td><td>$13,402</td><td>$34,636</td></tr><tr><td>State</td><td>$8,077</td><td>$5,787</td><td>$14,957</td></tr><tr><td>Local</td><td>$8,502</td><td>$6,092</td><td>$15,744</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>$35,282</td><td>$25,280</td><td>$65,337</td></tr></tbody></table>

If you actually voted, the government spent $65,337 on your behalf this year.

You could have bought a car. Or paid off student loans. Or invested it and retired early.

Instead, the government spent it for you. On things. Lots of things. Some useful. Some less so.

Think of it like when your mom said she was "holding onto" your birthday money for safekeeping, except your mom is the federal government and the birthday money is $65,337 and you never see it again and also your mom bought a fighter jet.
