The entire US Federal Budget alone is [$4.4 trillion](https://www.thebalance.com/u-s-federal-budget-breakdown-3305789) and the US population is [328,316,410](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/us-population/). Dividing the US budget by the US population produces $13,401 in federal spending per American.

[$1.87 trillion](https://www.usgovernmentspending.com/total) in state spending produces [$5,695](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HAn-f1qpK7r0oJ8iKSOjY85xPk7USC6Ed7Z5A5ej9JE/edit?usp=sharing) per person in state government spending.

[$1.99 trillion](https://www.usgovernmentspending.com/total) in local spending produces [$6,061](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HAn-f1qpK7r0oJ8iKSOjY85xPk7USC6Ed7Z5A5ej9JE/edit?usp=sharing) per person in local government spending.

Total government spending per capita is [$25,280](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HAn-f1qpK7r0oJ8iKSOjY85xPk7USC6Ed7Z5A5ej9JE/edit?usp=sharing).

If you actually voted, the government spent $65,337 on your behalf this year.

You could have bought a car. Or paid off student loans. Or invested it and retired early.

Instead, the government spent it for you. On things. Lots of things. Some useful. Some less so.

Think of it like when your mom said she was "holding onto" your birthday money for safekeeping, except your mom is the federal government and the birthday money is $65,337 and you never see it again and also your mom bought a fighter jet.
