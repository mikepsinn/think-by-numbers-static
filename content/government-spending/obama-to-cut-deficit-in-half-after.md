    While the post uses punchy analogies to effectively illustrate the concept
    of statistical spin, it suffers from factual inaccuracies regarding
    historical deficit numbers and lacks the necessary economic context of the
    2008 financial crisis.

The Associated Press ran a story titled "Obama plans to slash deficit in half." This is technically true. It's also technically misleading.

## The Actual Math

Here's a graph from the Wall Street Journal showing annual federal budget deficits over 30 years:

Bush's worst deficit was less than $500 billion.

Obama's first year deficit hit $2 trillion.

Four years later, Obama announced he would reduce the deficit to $533 billion.

## How to Spin Anything

Step 1: Quadruple the deficit to $2 trillion.

Step 2: Reduce it to $533 billion.

Step 3: Claim you cut the deficit in half.

This is accurate in the same way that setting your house on fire and then putting out half the fire makes you a responsible homeowner.

It's also like eating 12 donuts and then only eating 6 donuts the next day and calling yourself a fitness influencer. Technically, you did cut your donut consumption in half. The fire department would like a word, though.

$533 billion would still be the largest annual deficit in US history at that time. But the AP framed this as fiscal responsibility.

You could also raise the deficit to $10 trillion and then cut it to $5 trillion and claim you "slashed the deficit in half." The math works. The logic doesn't.
