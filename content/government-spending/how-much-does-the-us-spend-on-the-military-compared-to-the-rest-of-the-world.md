    The content effectively uses satire to highlight the massive opportunity
    cost of US military spending, which directly relates to the mission of
    maximizing median wealth/happiness by questioning resource allocation.
    However, the data is significantly outdated; the US military budget has
    surpassed $800-900 billion in recent years, making the $600 billion figure
    used here a low estimate that actually undersells the current scale of the
    issue. While the logic and comparison to Switzerland's GDP remain a strong
    'evergreen' rhetorical device, the outdated statistics reduce its immediate
    impact for 2024 discourse.

## The Numbers

The US spends 37% of all global military spending.

The US represents 4.4% of the world's population.

Some people think these numbers don't match up, but that's because they don't understand how percentages work. When you have 4.4% of something, the mathematically correct amount of military spending is obviously 37%. It's just science.

## What This Means

You spend more on weapons than the next eight countries combined. Most of those countries are your allies. Some are not even countries that exist anymore on this chart.

This is called "being thorough." If you're going to outspend someone, you might as well outspend them so hard they stop existing as a country. That's just good follow-through.

World military spending totals $1.6 trillion per year. You account for $600 billion of that.

For comparison, the entire GDP of Switzerland is $700 billion. You spend almost as much on the military as Switzerland makes doing everything.

Switzerland makes chocolate, watches, and provides banking services to dictators. You make aircraft carriers. Both are valid economic strategies.

The math is simple. You have 4.4% of the world's people and spend 37% of the world's military budget. Either your military is protecting eight times more than your share of humanity, or your spending is roughly eight times what it needs to be.

There is a third option: you could spend a normal amount and use the savings for literally anything else. But before you criticize military spending, try spending $700 billion yourself. It's harder than it sounds. Where would you even keep that much money? You'd need at least three really big rooms.
