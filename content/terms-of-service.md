# Terms of Service – Think by Numbers

## Who We Are

The website is located at [https://thinkbynumbers.org](https://thinkbynumbers.org).

## Personal Data Collection

### Comments

When visitors submit comments, the site collects form data, IP addresses, and browser information for spam detection. Email addresses are hashed for Gravatar integration. Profile pictures become publicly visible with approved comments.

### Media

Users should avoid uploading images containing embedded location data (EXIF GPS), as visitors can extract this information from website images.

### Cookies

Comment-related cookies persist for one year for user convenience. Login cookies last two days; "Remember Me" extends this to two weeks. Screen preference cookies last one year. Editorial activity cookies expire after one day.

### Embedded Content

Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website. Third-party sites may collect data and use tracking mechanisms independent of this site.

### Analytics

Analytics tracking is implemented on the site.

## Data Retention and Rights

Comments and metadata are retained indefinitely to facilitate automatic approval of follow-up comments. Registered users can access, edit, or delete their profile information anytime, though usernames cannot be changed. Site administrators retain editing privileges.

Users can request data exports or deletion, except where legal or administrative obligations require retention.

## Third-Party Services

Comments undergo automated spam detection screening. Gravatar's privacy policy applies to email hash processing.
