		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Unemployment has never feel below 3%.&quot; This is actually a good thing. Economists have found that the ideal level of unemployment is greater than 4% but less than 5.7%. This is because, I believe, when we have unemployment levels less than 4%, it could be a big indication that we are in a unsustainable expansion (the housing bubble was a good example of unsustainable expansion). 

Also, one must remember that there are 3 types of unemployment. They are as follows: 

1) Cyclical Unemployment 
2) Structural Unemployment
3) Frictional Unemployment 

Cyclical is related to recessions/depressions--it is bad in the long term and short term. 

Structural Unemployment is related to when a technology or method cause unemployment--for example, when the plow was invented we needed less berry pickers (thus causing people to unemployed). This is definitely something good in the long run because those berry pickers find other employable opportunities in the economy thus making us produce more for our hour worked, etc. 

Frictional Unemployment is voluntary unemployment. Think guy who doesn&#039;t accept the first available job because he believes he has better qualifications and wants a job that he can commit too and keep while being satisfied (nothing wrong with that!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Richard H. Moore!


THanks for commenting! :D

I agree that looking at correlations of GDP growth with those other factors would be optimal.  Unfortunately, I haven&#039;t found the time to do that yet.  



However, doing that would not disprove the fact that in general above 20% government spending to GDP ratio, GDP growth declines.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree that military spending is more likely to harm GDP growth. 

However, I&#039;m just looking at general trends based on many countries over many years.  You can always find outliers (like Ireland) when looking at statistical data.  

Like you said, there are many variables (such as how much goes to militarism) that can pull a data point away from the trendline.  

However, the trendline exists. 

Maybe it would be better to look at military spending as a percent of GDP vs GDP growth 

and 

social spending as a percent of GDP vs GDP growth.

If you can find any graphs of those, I would be happy to include them.

THanks, DC! :D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Steve Roth/Asymptosis.com ! thanks for commenting!  Does your 28% tax rate include state and local taxes?  Does it include spending borrowed money?  I would think you would want to look at spending as a percent of GDP rather than taxes.  

If you do, I believe you&#039;ll find that Europe and the United States are about the same w/ respect to spending as a percentage of GDP. The US just spends more on militarism and Europe spends more on social services.

With regard to cherry picking time spans, could you cherry pick a 10 year time span that shows a positive correlation between government spending and GDP growth?


If you can, i would love to put it at the very beginning of this article.  Thanks! :D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is interesting data, but does not support the proffered interpretation.  What it shows, is an &#039;optimal level&#039; of spending, not a linearly diminishing return.  Rather, below the &#039;optimal level&#039; it is quite clear that more government spending is needed.  But, this overall analysis is incomplete at best.  It is also necessary to look at such factors as stratification and concentration of wealth and income.  Inequity produces privation and rebellion.  There is a case to be made that freedom and happiness diminish beyond a certain point; but also that they increase up to that point.  It is also an obvious point that growth is going to be greater in economies that are underdeveloped, and less in those that are highly developed - because ecology imposes constraints, which are not considered in this analysis.  So, in sum, the analysis is simplistic and naive, but makes a point - mostly that nations should strive for balanced and sustainable development, not maximum growth nor minimum government expenditures.]]></description>
