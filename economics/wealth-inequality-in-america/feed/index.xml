		<description><![CDATA[The poor are poor at wealth accumulation and just about anything in life - they are life&#039;s losers. Lazy, stupid, insane, whatever at wealth accumulation.


The rich are genius at accumulating wealth; they are the risk-takers, the folks who risk it all for gain - many fail but a few make it big.


The 1% are the folks who determine how a society develop - they drive a society to excellence.


So suck it up you who are poor and be glad the rich exist......because you suck at it..........]]></description>
