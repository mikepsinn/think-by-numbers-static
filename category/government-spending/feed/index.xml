<p>The US spends more than $500 million per victim on anti-terrorism efforts. &nbsp;However, cancer research spending is only $10,000 per victim. &nbsp;Evolutionary psychology may offer an explanation for this irrational threat amplification.</p>
<h6>But first a message from NATIONAL REPUBLICAN campaign committee:</h6>
<p><em>Lightning.</em></p>
<p><em>Over the last decade it has stricken more Americans than terrorists have. It will stop at nothing to destroy our way of life.</em></p>
<p><em>Yet some politicians in Washington don’t see lightning as a threat.&nbsp;Barack&nbsp;Hussein Obama&nbsp;<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">doesn</span>’t. In the Senate, he voted to allocate hundreds of billions of dollars to the so-called war on terror, while spending absolutely nothing on a threat which has taken far more American lives. He just <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">doesn</span>’t get it.</em></p>
<p><em>Barack Obama.</em></p>
<p><em>Wrong on lightning.</em></p>
<p><em>Wrong for America.</em></p>
<h3>Putting Terrorism in Perspective</h3>
<p>Roughly <a href="http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/crt/2003/33777.htm">3,000 Americans</a> have lost their lives to terrorist attacks in the last decade. This averages out to a loss of 300 people a year, which is a tragic figure and, as a country, it behooves us to do everything we can to reduce or eliminate the threat of terrorism. But there are still a lot of other ways to wind up being the main course at a worm banquet. The gravest dangers we face include heart disease, cancer, and celebrity breakups. Unfortunately, our country doesn’t have infinite resources available to eliminate every threat. So the task falls to our government to allocate what resources we do have in a manner proportional to the magnitude of each threat. If we, as a society, want to effectively counter the dangers we face, we first have to put them in perspective.</p>
<h3>How You&#8217;re Really Going to Die</h3>
</div>
<p>Ranked by the number of victims, heart disease comes in as the number one threat. It’s responsible for <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr51/nvsr51_05.pdf">70</a><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr51/nvsr51_05.pdf">0,000 deaths</a>&nbsp;a year. This coronary malady keeps food on the tables of funeral directors nationwide. And, like a perpetual motion machine, this very food fills their arteries with cholesterol leading to even more heart attacks.</p>
<p>On to number two. Cancer kills <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr51/nvsr51_05.pdf">550,000 people a year</a>. But ironically, some futurists see it as a potential key to immortality. It removes the limit on the number of times that a cell can replicate itself. Thus, if properly harnessed, this disease could be used to defy aging by allowing eternal tissue regeneration. This would enable Joan Rivers to continue enchanting Americans with her iconic brand of celebrity commentary for generations to come.</p>
</div>
<p><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr51/nvsr51_05.pdf">Runners up for the best solution to overpopulation include strokes with 160,000 casualties a year, respiratory disease with 120,000 casualties annually, diabetes at 70,000 , pneumonia at 60,000 , Alzheimer’s disease at 50,000 , and vehicular accidents at 40,000.</a></p>
<p>As previously stated, averaged over the last decade which contained the worst terrorist attack in our nation’s history, terrorism still only killed about 300 people a year. Compare this to the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090410234302/http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov:80/resources/Ltg%20Safety-Facts.pdf">1000 people</a> who are struck by lightning every year. Hopefully, by putting storm clouds on the federal no-fly list we’ll be able to reduce this number in the future. But until then, based on current trends you’re three times more likely to be struck by lightning than to be killed in a terrorist attack.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Screwed Up Spending Priorities</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve compared the risks, let’s examine how the government chooses to allocate our limited resources to combat these threats. To the least likely means of death I’ve mentioned, terrorism, the federal government devotes about <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL33110.pdf">$150 billion annually</a>. On the other hand, to combat the most likely cause of death, heart disease, the government contributes only <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090115095455/http://www.nih.gov//news/fundingresearchareas.htm">$2 billion</a>. And just <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090115095455/http://www.nih.gov//news/fundingresearchareas.htm">$300 million</a>&nbsp;is devoted to research on the third most likely cause of death, strokes.</p>
<p>So looking at it another way, we spend $500 million for every death from terrorism and only $2,000 for every death resulting from strokes. That means we spend 250,000 times more per death on terrorism. I’m sure all of this is very flattering to Osama bin Laden, but this disparity might leave some stroke victims scratching their heads, assuming they’ve retained full motor control of their arms.</p>

<h3>Why is the government response so disproportionate to the threat?</h3>
<h6>EVOLUTION</h6>
<p>Evolutionary psychology may be able to explain this phenomenon. The human brain has been around for 200,000 years. &nbsp; More than 99% of that evolution has been characterized by starvation and general scarcity of resources typified the environment in which humans evolved. &nbsp;In this situation, violent acquisition of resources from other groups was often a necessary survival&nbsp;technique. Hence, human brains most hyper-vigilant and&nbsp;aggressive&nbsp;toward human threats (i.e. terrorists) were most likely to survive and propagate these&nbsp;characteristics.</p>
<p>On the other hand, throughout evolutionary history medical science was almost non-existent. &nbsp;Hence, there would be no survival value added by a tendency to focus on more likely health-related causes of death. We just weren&#8217;t designed for these times.</p>
<h6>Anxiety Fatigue</h6>
<p>One possible reason is anxiety fatigue. When an individual is subjected to a stimulus for an extended period of time, such as the aroma of a hospital room, the sound of a fan, or the endless nagging of the mother-in-law, their mind eventually just filters it out. Mortality risks such as heart disease and cancer extend farther back in time than even the existence of our current civilization. Our society now more or less accepts these unfortunate facts of life as another cost of doing business.Thus, they’re filtered out of our collective consciousness to some extent. On the other hand, consider the SARS virus scare a few years ago. Despite the absence of a single American fatality, the newness of this airborne illness allowed it to occupy headlines for weeks. Similarly, the Islamic terrorist menace is also a relatively new phenomenon to the US. Maybe threat fatigue for terrorism just hasn’t set in yet.</p>
<h6>Economic Consequences</h6>
<p>The economic consequences of terrorism would, at first thought, seem like a justification for the level of concern. There was a huge financial cost associated with the 9/11 attacks. Total related insurance claim payments are estimated at <a href="http://www.iii.org/page-not-found?attempt=yy_obj_data/binary/760752_1_0/September%252011%2520Anniversary.pdf">$32.5 billion</a>. However, there’s been no definitive proof that the attacks lead to a significant decline in GDP. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061105182817/http://safespaces.com/SS.Security_htm/Security_Terrorism_Cost.htm">In fact, a GDP which had been falling due to recession in the quarter prior to 9/11 actually started growing again in the quarter following 9/11.</a></p>
<p>It’s conventional wisdom that military spending is good for the economy. However, most macroeconomic models show that, in the long term, military spending diverts resources from productive uses, such as consumption and investment. This ultimately slows economic growth and reduces employment. So if one thinks they’re protecting our economy by taking trillions of dollars away from other productive uses to fight the so-called global war on terror, they should consider upgrading their abycuss to a calculator.</p>
<h6>Nuclear Bombs</h6>
<p>Another seemingly more justifiable reason for a magnified response to terrorism is the potential for a nuclear attack that could result in a far greater number of casualties than the typical terrorist attacks have to date. According to many experts on nuclear proliferation, the possibly insurmountable technical challenges of building or acquiring a thermo-nuclear weapon are enormous. <a href="http://www.iiss.org/en/about-s-us/press-s-room">Including the requirement that the weapon be portable, makes the likelihood of acquisition dramatically more remote. </a>However, there is a real threat that highly enriched uranium could be aquired from a former Soviet state and used to make a crude bomb. This is a serious risk and needs to be addressed by either securing or downgrading the 1000 tons of yellowcake remaining within Russia and her neighbors. The government currently spends about a billion dollars on this effort annually. Compare this to the two billion we spend in Iraq every week and one might assume we have a bonobo setting our national security priorities in exchange for bananas.</p>
<h6>Human Psychology</h6>
<p>Finally, the psychological makeup of our species could also be a contributing factor to this risk amplification. Just look at the plot structure of a work of fiction. The vast majority of conflicts are between a human protagonist and a human antagonist.We seem to maintain an inherent attraction to interpersonal or, on a larger scale, inter-societal conflict. It’s only natural that this affinity translates to our media diet as well. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110812194103/http://comminfo.rutgers.edu/jri/workingpapers/agendasettingsars2003.html">Many studies have shown that the media sets the public policy agenda.</a>So, the point is that interpersonal and societal conflicts like that between Western civilization and Muslim extremists are simply better able to maintain our attention than conflicts between man and complex, abstract medical threats.</p>
<p>In addition, sociologists and psychologists have determined that society amplifies the danger of risks imposed upon them, such as terrorism. Conversely, society finds risks resulting from voluntary behavior, such as car accidents, more acceptable.</p>

<p>The financial sector receives more of the average paycheck than any other sector of the economy. &nbsp;Its share of the economy totals $2 trillion dollars.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;1985, the financial sector earned less than 16% of domestic corporate profits. &nbsp;Today, it&#8217;s over&nbsp;40%.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, finance and insurance accounted for only <a href="https://myaccount.nytimes.com/auth/login?URI=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2009%2F03%2F27%2Fopinion%2F27krugman.html%3F_r%3D5&amp;REFUSE_COOKIE_ERROR=SHOW_ERROR">4%</a> of GDP, whereas in 2007 finance and insurance accounted for <a href="https://myaccount.nytimes.com/auth/login?URI=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2009%2F03%2F27%2Fopinion%2F27krugman.html%3F_r%3D5&amp;REFUSE_COOKIE_ERROR=SHOW_ERROR">8%</a> of GDP.</p>
<p>The purpose of the financial services industry is basically to transfer money from savers to entrepreneurs. It primarily consists of using a computer to shift money from one bank account to another. This service requires virtually no physical labor and very few material resources.</p>
<p>Yet, this relatively simple service cost our country more than <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090313222046/http://www.workforce.az.gov/admin/uploadedPublications/2100_gdp.xls">$2 trillion</a> in 2007. That was more than the country spent on health care, construction, food, utilities or&nbsp;transportation.</p>

How can&nbsp;financial paper shuffling to cost us more than the construction of the skyscraper where the paper shuffling will then take place? How does this industry get us to spend such an inordinate amount of money on their services?</p>
<p>The free market system automatically optimizes resource allocation to satisfy society&#8217;s wants and needs. The current problems in our financial sector can be seen as our economy&#8217;s attempt to reduce the excessive size of the financial sector and redirect those resources to more productive purposes. Yet, the government is doing everything in its power to counteract this process. The feds have taken or committed to take over <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090505164441/http://www.bloomberg.com:80/apps/news?pid=20601087%26sid=armOzfkwtCA4%26refer=home">$12 trillion</a> from the other sectors and given them to financial institution to maintain this imbalance. This works out to <a href="http://ww4.totalnoid.com/?kwrf=https%3A%2F%2Fthinkbynumbers.org">$42,105</a> for every man, woman and child in the U.S.</p>
<p>The financial sector is at a historic high as share of the overall economy.</p>

<p>Note another year in history when it peaked, 1929. &nbsp;At that time, many of the country&#8217;s resources were shifted to this low-employee, unproductive sector. &nbsp;It was followed by a decade of unemployment and economic stagnation. &nbsp;This would suggest that it may be unwise for the government to fuel this bloating if they wish to avoid another lost decade.</p>
<p>This begs the question &#8220;Why is government taking money from the paychecks of working people and giving it to AIG and Goldman-Sachs?&#8221; They claim that their failure will result in the collapse of our entire economic system. &nbsp;This would, of course, eventually lead to a dystopian Mad Max scenario. However, the presented choice between government bailout and complete financial collapse is a false dichotomy. In reality, if the government allowed these irresponsible actors to fail, they would enter a bankruptcy process and be sold off to more smaller, more responsible companies.</p>
<p>Correlation doesn&#8217;t necessarily imply causation. However, the reason the government is so set on using tax dollars to prop up these insolvent companies (as opposed to taking the bankruptcy route) might be related to campaign contributions. For instance, AIG executives gave more than <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=7110145">$630,000</a> during the 2008 political cycle even as the company was falling apart. President Obama collected a total of <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=7110145&amp;page=1">$130,000</a> from AIG in 2008, while McCain accepted a total of <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=7110145&amp;page=1">$59,499</a>. Last year AIG and its subsidiaries spent about <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2009/03/before-the-fall-aig-payouts-we/">$9.7 million</a> on federal lobbying, or about $53,000 for every day Congress was in session in 2008. Additionally, Obama&#8217;s top presidential campaign contributor was <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/earl-ofari-hutchinson/mccain-and-obamas-wall-st_b_129872.html">Goldman-Sachs</a>. McCain&#8217;s was Merril-Lynch.</p>
<p>For all the awful investments AIG made, this political investment has produced a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/03/16/AIG.bonuses/">1730000%</a> rate of return.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Q: Should I vote?</h1>
<h2>Self-Interested Answer: No, you might die.</h2>
<div>There&#8217;s less than a <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-odds-that-my-vote-changes-the-outcome-of-an-election">0.00001% chance</a> that your vote will be the tiebreaker that decides the outcome of a national election.  You are more likely to be injured in a car accident driving to the polls (<a href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/811552">0.002% chance</a>).  Hence, if you are trying to make a practical improvement in your life and those of your loved ones, it is much more rational to just stay home on election day.</div>
<div>
<h2>Civic-Minded Answer: Yes, if you&#8217;re more informed on the issues and candidates than the average voter.</h2>
<div>If you have a relatively informed opinion on the ability of the candidates to reduce suffering in the world, you should exercise your irrational desire to vote. At least then you can say that you&#8217;re part of the solution.</div>
<div></div>
<div>But if you do this, you should vote based on your civic duty to express your opinion about who would be the best person for the job regardless of party or ballot status. &#8220;Pragmatically&#8221; voting for the lesser of two evils only serves to validate evil in what is effectively just a public opinion poll.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Dear Decent American Citizen,</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you&#8217;ve read any of my articles on <a href="/">thinkbynumbers.org</a>, you know that there are a lot of things going on in this world that don&#8217;t make any sense.  For a long time, I kind of thought that I must be crazy and everyone was just too polite to tell me. I was certain that there was something I was missing that could explain why we allocate society’s limited resources in such an idiotic fashion.</p>
<p>For instance, President Obama just announced that he wants to spend <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/02/health/obama-brain-research/?hpt=hp_t2">$100 million</a> a year studying the brain. This is a wonderful thing.  The brain is the sole source of all joy and suffering in the universe.  However, while President Obama is busy patting himself on the back about this, world governments are spending <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures">$1.8 TRILLION</a> each year finding ways to murder us and destroy our property.  I put these numbers in an excel spreadsheet.  I had to make the column representing military spending 17,000 pixels high in order to make the brain research spending even visible (1 pixel high).  It&#8217;s fucking ridiculous.</p>

<p dir="ltr">A little less than a year ago, I came up with an easy <a href="/3-easy-steps/">3 step plan</a> to abolish unnecessary by optimally allocating societal resources using a form of crowd-sourced direct democracy which you can read about at <a href="/3-easy-steps/">CrowdsourcingUtopia</a>.</p>
<p>These are the steps:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Learn</strong> – Learn as much as you can about all relevant public policy issues. This requires that individuals ignore partisan warfare and focus on hard data. This step will be facilitated by the crowd-sourced and <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/jane_mcgonigal_gaming_can_make_a_better_world" target="_blank">gamified</a> public policy data repository known as the <a href="/">Think by Numbers</a> Project. Anyone may contribute their own articles. Since there will be lots of spam and garbage submitted, posts will be ordered using a democratic voting system. This will give the best content the most focus. It will encourage friendly competition among authors incentivizing them to produce their best work. Creation a sister wiki-version of each post that may be edited by any member of the site. The wiki-versions will be much more thorough, detailed, accurate, and objective that the original posts. However, it’s likely that they will be bland and less entertaining than the original posts. That’s why we will allow the original author to maintain full editorial control over their version.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Decide</strong> – Decide which problems cause the most suffering and which solutions are most cost effective. This was not previously something that could be quantified due to their inherent complexity. However, there is a new tool call crowd-sourcing which could be used to facilitate this. Two <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20131105060016/http://spectregroup.wordpress.com:80/2011/05/page/2/" target="_blank">examples</a> of effective crowd-sourcing were guessing the weight of an ox and finding a missing submarine.</p>
<p>Cost-effectiveness calculations will be accomplished using an online database where users can see a list of all the major problems in the world. A problem is just an issue or situation that causes suffering. The user can then submit their estimations of the magnitude of the suffering (either using a dollar figure or a unit of pleasure called a util or hedon) caused by each major world problem. All submissions are then averaged and problems are ranked according to the degree of suffering caused by each.</p>
<p>Users can also submit ideas for possible solutions. Then everyone can submit their estimates on how much each solution will cost and how much suffering it will reduce. Then the amount of suffering eliminated divided by the cost of the solution will give you a value representative of the cost-effectiveness of that solution. This step is known as the Crowdsourcing Utopia Project.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Act</strong> – In the final step, a charitable foundation will acquire and direct resources towards realizing the most cost effective solutions. This might be called the Charitable Foundation for the Abolition of Suffering. It is hoped that this will take over many functions that government is currently supposed to be fulfilling, but is not due to incompetence and/or corruption.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To my surprise, no one seemed to give a damn about it. Initially, I was completely baffled by this. &#8220;What could possibly be more important than fixing our corrupt political system?&#8221; I asked myself. I mean, we spend <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130906063946/http://www.wrhambrecht.com/pdf/SportsMarketReport_2012.pdf">$25.4 billion</a> dollars a year enabling a large number of grown men to do various things with various types of spheres for no reason. As a society, shouldn&#8217;t we be spending even a tiny fraction of our unimaginable wealth to create a system that would optimally allocate resources in a manner that would minimize suffering throughout the world?  I was so confused.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, since then, I have had an epiphany which can explain how a world that contains so much unnecessary suffering will allow its governments to squander our bountiful resources on idiotic pursuits such as the <a href="/terrorism/suicide-terrorism-statistics/">war in Iraq</a> and the <a href="/government-spending/drug-war-statistics/">War on Drugs</a>.  The reason the world is so screwed up is because open-minded, thoughtful, self-critical people who can see the world as it really is are often completely dejected and demoralized by the reality they see. Furthermore, these people who possess an acute awareness of the importance of reducing suffering are often crippled by the scourges of the mind known as depression and anxiety.  This leaves the levers of world power to the type A, alpha-male (often <a href="https://archive.org/details/NarcissistsAndPsychopathsInGovernmentResearchPackageV1">psychopathic</a>) personalities that are supremely assertive and confident in their beliefs. Their myopic worldview has no conception of the severity of suffering that is going on all over the world. This is because they are generally psychologically very healthy and have never experienced true suffering themselves.  The result is that they posses a complete lack of empathy. However, they simply know what they want and are willing to do whatever they have to do to get it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">People often assume a causal relationship between power and corruption. However, there is only a correlation.  This correlations exists because the corrupt, psychopathic, type A personalities simply have a distinct advantage when it comes to acquiring power. They are not bound by rules of morality.  They are not typically confined to the state of analysis paralysis that most introspective individuals find themselves in.</p>
<p>The reason the open-minded, self-critical, introspective people throughout the world remain in their psychological cages is because the field of modern psychiatry is not taking an aggressive, data-centric approach to curing their illness and maximizing their happiness. As a result, the world is filled with the walking dead geniuses that are paralyzed by fear and self-doubt. Since I cured my lifelong depression, I feel like a zombie who just woke up but is still surrounded by a bunch of other zombies that are just stumbling around aimlessly.  I desperately want to wake all of them up so they can be happy and help me to eradicate suffering from the world.  That’s what I am trying to do with <a href="https://quantimo.do/">Quantimodo</a>.</p>
<p>We find ourselves at an inflection point in history. If <a href="https://quantimo.do/">crowdsourcing </a>positive psychology research can help to wipe out depression, anxiety, and other mental illnesses, then these thoughtful, self-critical, and open-minded individuals will gain the confidence and assertiveness that is required to obtain positions of power.  Once we reclaim control from these psychopaths, I believe we&#8217;re going to see exponential declines in net world suffering as we begin implementing rational resource allocation policies.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="header">Dear President Obama,</p>
<p>I know you&#8217;re very busy, so I&#8217;m very sorry to bother you with this. However, I think what I have to say too important for you to ignore.  I appreciate that you are trying to make the world a better place. I respect you as a person. Against all adversity you have achieved some very amazing things.<a href="https://i1.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/image_gallery.gif"><img class="alignright" title="No Drugs!" src="https://i1.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/image_gallery.gif?resize=138%2C138" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<div id="contents">
<p>I would also like to make it completely clear that I abhor the use of the majority of illegal drugs.  The adverse health effects and insidious addiction that comes along with drugs like cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin have destroyed countless lives.  I never want my daughter or anyone to do any of those drugs.  When I was a child, my grandmother and sister were killed and my back was broken as a result of someone’s irresponsible use of drugs.</p>
<p>So I am completely aware of the fact that there can be horrific and permanent negative consequences to the abuse of drugs.  However, imprisoning people for the possession of these substances does not erase this harm. The War on Drugs was in full effect when my sister and grandmother were killed, and it certainly didn&#8217;t protect them.</p>
<p>Every <a href="https://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2009/arrests/index.html" target="_blank">minute</a> someone is arrested for simple drug possession in the United States.  In 2011, marijuana possession arrests totaled <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/17/marijuana-possession-arrests_n_2490340.html" target="_blank">663,032</a>.  Despite your <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/14/obama-pot-washington-colorado_n_2299512.html">claims</a> that going after recreational pot users in states where it is legal is not &#8220;a top priority&#8221;, your administration <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150104151404/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/26/medical-marijuana-la-feds_n_1916191.html" target="_blank">has continued to aggressively target</a> dispensaries that are in compliance with state law. I and others have shouldered the <a href="http://www.drugscience.org/Archive/bcr7/Gettman_Marijuana_Arrests_in_the_United_States.pdf">$10 billion</a> annual cost of arresting and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160706205438/http://ecolocalizer.com/2011/05/17/louisiana-man-sentenced-to-life-in-prison-for-marijuana-possession/">incarcerating</a> hundreds of thousands of people for the possession of marijuana. These arrests are often for small quantities for personal use.</p>
<p>I work 40 hours a week managing an <a href="http://labinc.com/">industrial testing chemistry lab</a>.  On top of that, over the last year I have been spending another 40 hours a week trying to build a <a href="https://quantimo.do/">web application</a> that I hope will help the millions of people in the world who suffer from the emotional hell that is depression.  It is my sincere hope that through improving exercise, diet, sleep, safe pharmacological measures and other treatments in conjunction with disciplined self-tracking of treatments, outcomes and adverse events, we can and will eradicate mental illness from the face of the earth.</p>
<p>You and George Bush have taken tens of thousands of dollars out of my paychecks over the last 10 years to pay for your <a href="/government-spending/corporate-welfare/corporate-vs-social-welfare/">corporate welfare</a>, <a href="/terrorism/suicide-terrorism-statistics/">foreign military occupations</a> and to imprison people for simple non-violent, drug possession.  The result is that I may run out of money before I achieve my goal.</p>
<p>In your <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/ondcp/2012_ndcs.pdf">2012 National Drug Control Strategy</a> you admit that “the War on Drugs is an utter failure”.  Here is a graph from an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/ondcp/infographic_obama_drug_policy_high-res.png">infographic</a> touting your “Record of Reform” which your drug czar, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gil_Kerlikowske">Gil Kerlikowske</a>, has provided us.  This graph breaks down how you wasted my money in 2012.</p>

<p>That graph suggests that you are spending more on prevention and treatment than you are on law enforcement and incarceration. However, to produce this appearance, it seems that you have to engage in some statistical trickery by separating out “Interdiction” and “International Programs” from the “Law Enforcement and Incarceration” bar.  In reality, you are still spending 50% more on law enforcement and incarceration than you are on prevention and treatment.  Here is a less deceitful version of your graph.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s worse, the money you are stealing from me isn&#8217;t even having any impact on the level of illicit drug use.  You are just tearing apart thousands of families for no reason. Addiction rates are at exactly the same level that they were before we spent <a href="http://www.mattgroff.com/questions-on-the-1315-project-chart/">$1.5 trillion</a> dollars on “drug control measures”.  This fact is illustrated in the <a href="http://www.mattgroff.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/13v15.gif">graph</a> below.</p>

<p>As a constitutional scholar, you are aware that the 10th Amendment states that powers not granted to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States">federal government</a> by the Constitution, nor prohibited to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state">States</a>, are reserved to the States or the people.</p>
<p>Here are the powers granted to the federal government by Article 1, Section 8 of the constitution:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States;</li>
<li>To borrow Money on the credit of the United States;</li>
<li>To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes;</li>
<li>To establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization, and uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States;</li>
<li>To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures;</li>
<li>To provide for the Punishment of counterfeiting the Securities and current Coin of the United States;</li>
<li>To establish Post Offices and post Roads;</li>
<li>To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries;</li>
<li>To constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme Court;</li>
<li>To define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas, and Offences against the Law of Nations;</li>
<li>To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water;</li>
<li>To raise and support Armies, but no Appropriation of Money to that Use shall be for a longer Term than two Years;</li>
<li>To provide and maintain a Navy;</li>
<li>To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces;</li>
<li>To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions;</li>
<li>To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress;</li>
<li>To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten Miles square) as may, by Cession of Particular States, and the Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of the United States, and to exercise like Authority over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State in which the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, dock-Yards and other needful Buildings</li>
<li>To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.</li>
</ol>
<p>You will note that the ability to restrict what materials individuals choose to put in their bodies is not on that list.  I presume that you would cite the commerce clause when trying to justify your actions. However, you know perfectly well that it is possible to produce and consume a substance without engaging in commerce or transporting it across state lines.  If one does this, I would admit that the federal government could have jurisdiction.  However, you are continuing to spend my money to imprison people who are not engaging in interstate commerce and merely possess restricted substances.  I don’t even think the states should be incarcerating people for nonviolent drug possession.  However, if someone is going to engage in such totalitarian activities, it should be state or local governments. The federal government absolutely no right to do any of this.</p>
<p>I further presume that you would defend your unconstitutional actions by claiming that the Constitution is not a static document, but a living one that must be read in the context of an ever-changing world. To that, I would say to look again at this <a href="http://www.mattgroff.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/13v15.gif">graph</a> that represents the reality of our ever-changing world.  Even if you twist the constitution into a pretzel to try to justify your actions over the last 4 years, the reality remains that these prohibitionist policies are not achieving their intended aims.</p>
<p>People with mental illness self-medicating themselves is the number one cause of illegal drug use. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreams_from_My_Father">Dreams From My Father</a>, you admitted that this was the reason you turned to drugs when you stated, &#8220;Pot had helped, and booze; maybe a little blow when you could afford it.&#8221;  The <a href="https://quantimo.do/">failure</a> of the mental health community to take a rigorous, data-centric approach to diagnosis and treatment is the reason that mental illness, and by extension illegal drug use is so pervasive in this country. If I had 0.1% of the $10 billion that you spend on law enforcement and incarceration, I could prevent more illegal drug use with my <a href="https://quantimo.do/">application</a> then you can with the entire $10 billion.</p>
<p>If you have any respect for democracy, you should at the very least end the federal prohibition of marijuana.  55% of Americans agree with me on this issue as is illustrated by this <a href="http://blogs.lawyers.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/MJ-Infographic.jpg">infographic</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.lawyers.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/MJ-Infographic.jpg?resize=600%2C4507" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To be fair, I would like to thank you for the progress you have made in reducing drug possession sentencing disparities.  I appreciate your true and good intentions.  I know that you want to reduce suffering in the world.  However, I would still like to politely request that you request $0 for federal incarceration of nonviolent drug offenders, interdiction, and “international programs” in your next budget proposal to congress.</p>

<blockquote><p>On Sept. 10, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld declared war. Not on foreign terrorists, &#8220;the adversary&#8217;s closer to home. It&#8217;s the Pentagon bureaucracy,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He said money wasted by the military poses a serious threat.</p>
<p>&#8220;In fact, it could be said it&#8217;s a matter of life and death,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Rumsfeld promised change but the next day – Sept. 11&#8211; the world changed and in the rush to fund the war on terrorism, the war on waste seems to have been forgotten.</p>
<p>Just last week President Bush announced, &#8220;my 2003 budget calls for more than $48 billion in new defense spending.&#8221;</p>
<p>More money for the Pentagon, <b>CBS News Correspondent Vince Gonzales</b> reports, while its own auditors admit the military cannot account for 25 percent of what it spends.</p>
<p>&#8220;According to some estimates we cannot track $2.3 trillion in transactions,&#8221; Rumsfeld admitted.</p>
<p>$2.3 trillion — that&#8217;s $8,000 for every man, woman and child in America. To understand how the Pentagon can lose track of trillions, consider the case of one military accountant who tried to find out what happened to a mere $300 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know it&#8217;s gone. But we don&#8217;t know what they spent it on,&#8221; said Jim Minnery, Defense Finance and Accounting Service.</p>

<h2>2013 Budget Plans</h2>
<h4>New Look! Same Great Waste!</h4>
<p>Obama&#8217;s 2013 budget is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_United_States_federal_budget">$3.80 Trillion</a>. Romney&#8217;s will be $3.79 trillion.</p>
<p>Budget Changes Specified by Candidate Romney™:</p>
<ol>
<li>Eliminate Obamacare (which is ironically very similar to Romneycare aside from the fact that Romneycare also covered abortions) &#8211; Estimated Savings = <a href="http://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=http://www.forbes.com/sites/aroy/2012/07/27/cbo-obamacare-will-spend-more-tax-more-and-reduce-the-deficit-less-than-we-previously-thought/&amp;refURL=https://thinkbynumbers.org&amp;referrer=https://thinkbynumbers.org">$122</a> billion annually</li>
<li>Increase Military Spending &#8211; Estimated Cost = <a href="https://myaccount.nytimes.com/auth/login?URI=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2011%2F11%2F07%2Fworld%2Fpanetta-weighs-military-cuts-once-thought-out-of-bounds.html%3F_r%3D5&amp;REFUSE_COOKIE_ERROR=SHOW_ERROR">$45</a> billion annually</li>
<li>Increase Medicare Spending &#8211; Estimated Cost = <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2012/08/a-campaign-full-of-mediscare/">$71</a> billion annually</li>
<li>&#8220;Deep Reductions&#8221; in funding for the National Endowment for the Arts &#8211; Estimated Savings = <a href="https://www.philanthropy.com/article/Arts-Spending-Cut-as-2012/195421">$0.15</a> billion annually</li>
<li>Eliminate Amtrak Subsidies &#8211; Estimated Savings = <a href="http://reason.com/archives/2011/11/09/absolutely-profligate">$1.6</a> billion annually</li>
<li>Eliminate Title X Family Planning Programs &#8211; Estimated Savings = <a href="http://khn.org/news/planned-parenthood-title-10/">$0.3</a> billion annually</li>
</ol>
<p>Add it up.  Romney&#8217;s Total Savings = $0.01 trillion less than Obama&#8217;s budget! With a national debt on the order of <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/debt/current">$16.2</a> trillion, you’ll barely even notice the difference!</p>
<h2>Past Spending Records</h2>
<h5>Are you tired of all that money cluttering up your home?  Try NEW PRESIDENT™!</h5>
<p>Governor Romney™ has been scientifically proven to increase spending faster than the President Obama™! Obama has only increased government spending a disappointing <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/the-facts-about-the-growth-of-spending-under-obama/2012/05/24/gJQAIJh6nU_blog.html">5.5%</a> annually over his term.</p>
<p>Under Governor Romney, Massachusetts state spending went from $22.3 billion to $28.1 billion,  an amazing <a href="https://myaccount.nytimes.com/auth/login?URI=http%3A%2F%2Fthecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com%2F2007%2F12%2F31%2Fclarification-on-huckabee-and-romney-spending%2F%3F_r%3D5&amp;REFUSE_COOKIE_ERROR=SHOW_ERROR">6.5%</a> per year! That’s faster than most other leading governors (6.2%)! And if we&#8217;ve learned anything from the vast disparity between George W. Bush’s fiscal rhetoric and <a href="https://www.mercatus.org/publication/spending-under-president-george-w-bush">fiscal record</a>, it’s that Romney’s gubernatorial record might be a better indicator of what we could expect from a Romney federal budget.</p>
<h2>Campaign Contributors</h2>

<p>It is commonly claimed that government spending <a title="Government Spending Stimulates The Economy, Unlike Tax Cuts" href="http://youtu.be/Sq3C2ySmPMI" target="_blank">is good for the economy</a>, but the statistics show the opposite.  Most <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1734206&amp;download=yes" target="_blank">recent studies</a> find a negative correlation between total government size and economic growth. Why is economic growth important?  Because wealthier societies are generally <a href="http://content.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,2016291,00.html">happier</a> societies.</p>
<p>No matter how good things get for us, we always want more. Human beings want better:</p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>food</li>
<li>housing</li>
<li>entertainment</li>
<li>transportation</li>
<li>health services</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>A certain level of government spending is necessary to maintain an economy that can provide and improve these things. A well-functioning economy requires government to:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>enforce contracts</li>
<li>protect a country from foreign invaders</li>
<li>keep people from stealing from each other</li>
<li>keep people from hurting each other</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>Government expenditure on these functions increases a country&#8217;s productivity.</div>

<p>However, when government spending exceeds these mandates, it takes the country&#8217;s human and material resource allocation decision-making power away from society&#8217;s massive collective of individual intelligences. This is a bad idea because individuals are just better at deciding how allocating resources to satisfy their own desires since:</p>
<div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>They cumulatively have access to infinitely more detailed and specific information than any small group of politicians and bureaucrats do.</li>
<li>Satisfying as many desires as possible (by maximizing productivity) is their sole incentive.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Politicians, on the other hand, do not allocate resources as productively (satisfy fewer human desires) because they:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Only have access to general demographic data</li>
<li>Are primarily incentivized to obtain campaign contributions to get re-elected</li>
</ul>
<p>The ability to obtain campaign contributions is primarily dependent on the candidate&#8217;s ability to divert the nation&#8217;s resources to corporations and special interest groups. Hence, resources are not specifically allocated to maximize their productivity, but are allocated in the pursuit of political goals.</p>

<p>The data show that a 10 percent increase in government expenditures as a share of GDP reduces the annual rate of growth by about 1 percent. The data also imply that the size of government in these countries is beyond the range that maximizes economic growth.</p>
<p>The graph contains four dots (observations) for each of the twenty-three countries (one for each of the four decades during the period 1960-1999). Each dot represents a country&#8217;s total government spending as a share of GDP at the beginning of the decade and its accompanying growth of real GDP during that decade. As the plotted line in the exhibit shows, there is a clearly observable negative relationship between size of governments and long-term real GDP growth. Countries with higher levels of government spending grew less rapidly. The line drawn through the points indicates that a 10-percentage-point increase in government expenditures as a share of GDP leads to approximately a 1-percentage-point reduction in economic growth.</p>

<p>The reason GDP matters is that it is directly correlated to a reduction in human suffering. Economic growth is the primary differentiating factor between a life lived in the US and a life lived in North Korea. Economic growth is the primary differentiating factor between a life lived in the 11th century and the 21st century. Economic growth has cured countless diseases which would have otherwise imbued countless lives with unimaginable suffering. Economic growth has prevented billions from dying of starvation. If governments will get out of its way, economic growth will eventually eliminate human suffering from the planet. Also, according to the most recent <a href="http://content.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,2016291,00.html" target="_blank">income/happiness study</a>, the lower a person&#8217;s annual income falls below $75,000 a year, the unhappier he or she feels. But no matter how much more than $75,000 people make, they don&#8217;t report any greater degree of happiness. The strong correlation between happiness and GDP is illustrated below.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It looks like Romney may have inherited Obama’s pocket liners. Take a look at Obama’s 2008 campaign contributors and Romney’s 2012 contributors and a disturbing trend emerges: the financial sector, the very sector that borrowed and is still paying the U.S. back billions in TARP benefits, has scooted over to Romney after having supported Obama four years ago. <strong>TARP</strong> <em>What is TARP?</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troubled_Asset_Relief_Program">TARP</a> is the controversial Wall Street bailout program first put into place by President Bush in 2008. The program was made because banks knowingly provided risky <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis">subprime mortgages</a>, which borrowers were oftentimes unable to pay back. There was speculation that the entire U.S. financial system was in jeopardy as a result (whether or not this was the case, however, is a matter of debate). <img data-attachment-id="2572" data-permalink="/government-spending/meet-the-backers-bankers-flip-flop-to-romney/attachment/tarp/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/TARp.png?fit=180%2C108&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="180,108" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="TARp" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/TARp.png?fit=180%2C108&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/TARp.png?fit=180%2C108&amp;ssl=1" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2572" title="TARP Bailout Program" src="https://i2.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/TARp.png?resize=180%2C108" alt="Cost of TARP program" data-recalc-dims="1" /> In any case, the U.S. government bought into many of the large banks that were struggling at the time, including AIG, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup. Romney has publicly <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/18/mitt-romney/did-mitt-romney-flip-flop-tarp/">endorsed</a> the TARP program on numerous occasions, and Obama <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodd%E2%80%93Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_and_Consumer_Protection_Act">saw it through</a> in his first term. TARP was risky, but in the end most of its participants bought back their assets. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the program will ultimately cost the U.S. <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/43138">$32 billion</a><em>.  </em> <strong> </strong> <strong>Campaign Contributions</strong> Interestingly, many of the companies that benefited from TARP made donations to the Obama campaign in 2008, despite the dire straits of their finances. Now, these banks have flip-flopped to greener pastures for the 2012 election. See the chart below:</p>
