“Obama plans to slash deficit in half” is the title of this AP story. The attribution of fiscal responsibility to our current president is rather misleading.

Here’s a graph from a [Wall Street Journal article](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123457407865686565) of the annual federal budget deficits over the last 30 years.

Bush’s worst deficit was less than $500 billion. Obama’s 1st might be [$2 trillion](http://www.atr.org/obamas-first-yearbr-trillion-new-proposed-a4416). Then in four years, he says he might decrease it to [$533 billion](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/21/AR2009022100911.html).

That’s still the worst annual deficit in the entire history of the United States. Then that AP story tries to portray him as a fiscal conservative.

Preposterous, indeed!
