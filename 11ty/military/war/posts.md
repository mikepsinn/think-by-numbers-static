1.  At least [100,000 civilians](https://myaccount.nytimes.com/auth/login?URI=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2010%2F10%2F23%2Fworld%2Fmiddleeast%2F23casualties.html%3F_r%3D5&REFUSE_COOKIE_ERROR=SHOW_ERROR) have been killed. That’s the equivalent of 35 September 11th attacks, but I don’t like to brag.
2.  Another interesting factoid is that the war will end up costing at least [$3 trillion](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/03/AR2010090302200.html).  With that much money, you could [end world hunger](http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/23/opinion/ed-food23) for 100 years or end American hunger for 100 minutes!
3.  Over [4 million Iraqis](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2007-06-05-iraq-report_N.htm) have lost their homes a result of the war.  That’s equivalent to the population of [Maine, Idaho, and New Hampshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population) combined. Sorry, guys. You cannot all crash on my couch.
