U.S. stocks gained 21% for the first two years of the Trump administration. versus 71.2% in the first two years of the Obama administration.

Obama did have an advantage in that he took office after a significant market correction.

However, claims that Trump’s business genius deserve credit for growth under his administration may not be justified since 21% is simply the long term average. Over the past 50 years the market has gained 10% a year on average. 21% over two years divided by 2 is 10.5% per year.
