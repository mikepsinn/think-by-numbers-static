Throughout history, petitions have been a crucial tool for social and political change. Understanding the percentage of population support needed for successful reform can provide valuable insights for modern movements.

## The 3.5% Rule

Research by Harvard political scientist [Erica Chenoweth](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190513-it-only-takes-35-of-people-to-change-the-world) has shown that movements which actively engage just 3.5% of the population rarely fail to bring about change. This finding comes from studying hundreds of campaigns across the last century.

## Notable Historical Petitions

### 1\. Hawaiian Kūʻē Petitions (1897)

-   **Signatures**: 21,269 (approximately 95% of native Hawaiian population)
-   **Impact**: Successfully delayed annexation
-   **Details**: The [Kūʻē Petitions](https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/hawaii-petition) represented one of the most successful petition campaigns by percentage of population in history. These “monster petitions” demonstrated overwhelming native opposition to U.S. annexation.

### 2\. Women’s Suffrage Movement

-   **Initial Petition (1866)**: 1,499 signatures
-   **Growth**: By the early 1900s, suffrage petitions gathered hundreds of thousands of signatures
-   **Significance**: The [1866 petition](https://www.tam.usace.army.mil/Portals/77/Women%27s%20Equality%20DAY%20Timeline.pdf) was groundbreaking as the first women’s suffrage petition presented to Parliament, paving the way for larger movements.

### 3\. Anti-Slavery Petitions (1830s)

-   **Scale**: Over 130,000 petitions to Congress
-   **Population Percentage**: Approximately 15% of Northern population
-   **Impact**: While not immediately successful, these petitions were crucial in the [abolition movement](https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/african-american-odyssey/abolition.html).

### 4\. Indian Independence Movement (1930s)

-   **Salt Satyagraha Petition**: ~2.5 million signatures
-   **Population Percentage**: Roughly 2% of India’s population
-   **Outcome**: Contributed to the successful nonviolent resistance movement for independence

## Modern Initiative Requirements

Today, U.S. states typically require varying percentages for ballot initiatives:

-   **California**: 5% for statutes, 8% for constitutional amendments
-   **Florida**: 8% of votes cast in last presidential election
-   **Other States**: Range from 2-15% of registered voters

## Key Findings

1.  Successful movements often combine petitions with other forms of civic engagement
2.  The percentage needed varies based on:
    -   Type of change sought
    -   Political context
    -   Broader movement support
3.  Modern democratic systems have codified specific percentage requirements
4.  Historical successes have ranged from 2% to 95% of population support

## Conclusion

While the “3.5% rule” provides a general threshold for successful movements, petition effectiveness historically has depended more on the broader context and movement strategy than raw numbers alone. Some reforms succeeded with just 2-3% of population support, while others required much larger percentages to create change.
