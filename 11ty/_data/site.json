    "bio": "Founder of the Decentralized Institutes of Health and Decentralized FDA. Guy with a computer who noticed we spend 604x more on weapons than curing the diseases killing 150,000 people daily (that's 50 9/11s per day, if anyone's counting).",
    "bioExtended": "Published thousands of observational studies applying novel causal inference algorithms to quantify the positive and negative effects of foods, drugs, and supplements on every aspect of human health. Turns out analyzing 10 million data points is easier than getting anyone to care about the results.",
    "mission": "Currently trying to convince people that redirecting 1% of military spending ($27B) toward pragmatic clinical trials could reduce drug development costs by 34x while saving 416 million lives. So far, approximately zero generals have returned my calls.",
