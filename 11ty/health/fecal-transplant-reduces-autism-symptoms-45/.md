Research has also found that autistic children often experience chronic [gastrointestinal problems](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3981895/) a lot more frequently than children without autism.

This has led scientists to [explore](https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-016-0225-7) whether microbiota transfer therapy (MTT) — can help solve gastrointestinal issues and affect other autism markers.

MTT involves collecting, processing, and freezing the fecal material of healthy people, and then administering it — orally or rectally — to the person receiving the treatment. Thus, the healthy bacteria should re-establish a balance in the gut microbiome of the person experiencing gastrointestinal problems.

Children involved in this study showed “a slow but steady improvement in core ASD symptoms,” with a 45 percent improvement in measurements related to language, social interaction, and behavior.
