> The people who developed dementia spent an average of [17](https://www.livescience.com/60216-decreased-rem-sleep-dementia-risk.html) percent of their sleep time in [REM sleep](https://www.livescience.com/59300-brain-cells-linked-to-dreaming-found.html), compared with [20](https://www.livescience.com/60216-decreased-rem-sleep-dementia-risk.html) percent for those who did not develop dementia. The researchers found that for every 1-percent reduction in REM sleep, there was a 9-percent increase in the risk of dementia.
