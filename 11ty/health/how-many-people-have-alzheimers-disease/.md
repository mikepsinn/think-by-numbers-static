Worldwide, **nearly** **[44 million](https://www.alzheimers.net/resources/alzheimers-statistics/)** people have Alzheimer’s or related dementia.

An estimated [5.8 million](https://dshs.texas.gov/alzheimers/qanda.shtm) Americans of all ages are living with Alzheimer’s disease in 2018.

The NIH spent **[$1.9 billion](https://www.mdedge.com/clinicalneurologynews/article/162218/alzheimers-cognition/federal-budget-grants-18-billion)** on Alzheimer’s research in 2018. This comes out to $327 per victim.
