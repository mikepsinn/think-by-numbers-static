<p>It is commonly claimed that government spending <a title="Government Spending Stimulates The Economy, Unlike Tax Cuts" href="http://youtu.be/Sq3C2ySmPMI" target="_blank">is good for the economy</a>, but the statistics show the opposite.  Most <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1734206&amp;download=yes" target="_blank">recent studies</a> find a negative correlation between total government size and economic growth. Why is economic growth important?  Because wealthier societies are generally <a href="http://content.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,2016291,00.html">happier</a> societies.</p>
<p>No matter how good things get for us, we always want more. Human beings want better:</p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>food</li>
<li>housing</li>
<li>entertainment</li>
<li>transportation</li>
<li>health services</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>A certain level of government spending is necessary to maintain an economy that can provide and improve these things. A well-functioning economy requires government to:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>enforce contracts</li>
<li>protect a country from foreign invaders</li>
<li>keep people from stealing from each other</li>
<li>keep people from hurting each other</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>Government expenditure on these functions increases a country&#8217;s productivity.</div>
<div></div>

<p>However, when government spending exceeds these mandates, it takes the country&#8217;s human and material resource allocation decision-making power away from society&#8217;s massive collective of individual intelligences. This is a bad idea because individuals are just better at deciding how allocating resources to satisfy their own desires since:</p>
<div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>They cumulatively have access to infinitely more detailed and specific information than any small group of politicians and bureaucrats do.</li>
<li>Satisfying as many desires as possible (by maximizing productivity) is their sole incentive.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Politicians, on the other hand, do not allocate resources as productively (satisfy fewer human desires) because they:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Only have access to general demographic data</li>
<li>Are primarily incentivized to obtain campaign contributions to get re-elected</li>
</ul>
<p>The ability to obtain campaign contributions is primarily dependent on the candidate&#8217;s ability to divert the nation&#8217;s resources to corporations and special interest groups. Hence, resources are not specifically allocated to maximize their productivity, but are allocated in the pursuit of political goals.</p>

<p>The data show that a 10 percent increase in government expenditures as a share of GDP reduces the annual rate of growth by about 1 percent. The data also imply that the size of government in these countries is beyond the range that maximizes economic growth.</p>
<p>The graph contains four dots (observations) for each of the twenty-three countries (one for each of the four decades during the period 1960-1999). Each dot represents a country&#8217;s total government spending as a share of GDP at the beginning of the decade and its accompanying growth of real GDP during that decade. As the plotted line in the exhibit shows, there is a clearly observable negative relationship between size of governments and long-term real GDP growth. Countries with higher levels of government spending grew less rapidly. The line drawn through the points indicates that a 10-percentage-point increase in government expenditures as a share of GDP leads to approximately a 1-percentage-point reduction in economic growth.</p>

<p>The reason GDP matters is that it is directly correlated to a reduction in human suffering. Economic growth is the primary differentiating factor between a life lived in the US and a life lived in North Korea. Economic growth is the primary differentiating factor between a life lived in the 11th century and the 21st century. Economic growth has cured countless diseases which would have otherwise imbued countless lives with unimaginable suffering. Economic growth has prevented billions from dying of starvation. If governments will get out of its way, economic growth will eventually eliminate human suffering from the planet. Also, according to the most recent <a href="http://content.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,2016291,00.html" target="_blank">income/happiness study</a>, the lower a person&#8217;s annual income falls below $75,000 a year, the unhappier he or she feels. But no matter how much more than $75,000 people make, they don&#8217;t report any greater degree of happiness. The strong correlation between happiness and GDP is illustrated below.</p>

<p>Empty houses in the US = <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/economy/housing/2009-02-12-vacancy12_N.htm">14 million</a>.</p>
<p>Median Home Price = <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/ConsumerNews/save-big-buy-foreclosed-house/story?id=13052724">$160,000</a>.</p>
<p>Money Wasted on Building Unneeded Homes = <a href="http://www.rd.com/money/the-government-is-wasting-your-tax-dollars/">$2 trillion</a>.</p>
<p>Why would Americans be so dumb as to build 14 million houses they didn&#8217;t need?  The two primary reasons we built too many houses are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <strong>United States spends more than $100 billion annually to subsidize homeownership</strong>.  The mortgage market is expanded through the government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Homeowners get a big deduction on federal income taxes for mortgage interest payments and for state and local property taxes and they even get favored treatment on capital gains from the sales of primary residences.</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Fed kept interest rates artificially too low for too long</strong> instead of using the natural market interest rate.  The government was keeping interest rates low because it was stimulating a short-term economic boom (excessive housing construction).  Politicians care primarily about short-term economic performance because the crash that happens in 5 years isn&#8217;t going to keep them from getting re-elected.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If the government did not engage in these acts of market manipulation, the boom would not have occurred and the crash would not have occurred.</p>
<p>Following 9/11 the Federal Reserve reacted to keep the stock market from continuing its decent and the economy from slipping into a recession. They began to lower interest rates to increase borrowing, producing short-term economic growth.</p>
<p>These artificially low-interest rates made it much cheaper to get a mortgage. The cheaper something is, the more people buy of it. Hence, lots of people stopped renting and got mortgages. The heightened demand for mortgages intrinsically meant a higher demand for houses. Since the demand for houses had increased the sellers were able to increase the price correspondingly. When investors saw house prices going up and up, they speculated that they could rely on that trend to continue. So, many investors bought houses with the plan of selling them at a later date when they were worth more money. The new demand for housing from speculators drove prices up even further which drew in more speculators. Rinse and repeat.</p>
<p>Is free market capitalism the culprit? That would be a reasonable theory if we&#8217;d had anything close to a free market within 100 years.  In a free market, prices are determined solely by supply and demand.  Prices act as signals telling an economy how to allocate its limited resources to most efficiently satisfy the desires of the people. When population increases, demand for houses increases. This results in the cost of a house to increase. This is a signal to investors that they should direct their capital at housing production and a signal to workers to go into the construction field. Hence, the function of prices in coordinating societal behaviour is pretty damn important.</p>
<p>However, in America, the Federal Reserve has the ability to alter the price of borrowing money so that the wrong signals get sent to workers and investors. Our current economic situation is the merely the consequence of this malinvestment.</p>
