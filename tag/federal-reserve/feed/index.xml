				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The cause of the US financial crisis is simple. It&#8217;s debt. This is a very simple and graphical evidence-based explanation of what caused the collapse.</p>
<p>The massive increase in the level of consumer debt prior to the recent financial crisis bears a striking resemblance to another period in economic history.  That other period of unprecedented borrowing occurred just before 1929.  Twin Peaks didn&#8217;t make it very clear who killed Laura Palmer, but they make it pretty obvious who killed the US economy. The murderer is debt.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/Twin-Peaks-of-Household-Debt-to-GDP-Ratio.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="762" data-permalink="/debt/household-debt-to-gdp-ratio-100/attachment/twin-peaks-of-household-debt-to-gdp-ratio/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/Twin-Peaks-of-Household-Debt-to-GDP-Ratio.jpg?fit=960%2C320&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="960,320" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Historical-Household-Debt-to-GDP-Ratio" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/Twin-Peaks-of-Household-Debt-to-GDP-Ratio.jpg?fit=300%2C100&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/Twin-Peaks-of-Household-Debt-to-GDP-Ratio.jpg?fit=960%2C320&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-762" title="Twin Peaks of Debt: Historical Household Debt to GDP Ratio" src="https://i2.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/Twin-Peaks-of-Household-Debt-to-GDP-Ratio.jpg?resize=605%2C202" alt="Graph of US Historical Household Debt to GDP Ratio" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/Twin-Peaks-of-Household-Debt-to-GDP-Ratio.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i2.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/Twin-Peaks-of-Household-Debt-to-GDP-Ratio.jpg?resize=300%2C100&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/Twin-Peaks-of-Household-Debt-to-GDP-Ratio.jpg?resize=768%2C256&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/Twin-Peaks-of-Household-Debt-to-GDP-Ratio.jpg?resize=672%2C224&amp;ssl=1 672w" sizes="(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">The Household Debt to GDP Ratio reached <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2009/02/household_debt_vs_gdp.html">100%</a> in 2007.  That means the average family owed as much on their mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards as they earn in a year. For a most of the 20th century, this ratio&#8217;s been under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_public_debt">50%</a>. The last time it reached 100% was 1929. Note the twin peaks in the graph.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In both crashes, the primary reason for the increase in debt is the Federal Reserve&#8217;s artificial lower of interest rates.  Initially, the lower rates cause people to borrow more to buy more.  This behavior serves as a signal to business that they should hire more people and expand their production capacity by building more factories and stuff.  This leads to short-term economic growth known as the &#8220;Boom&#8221;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This Boom period is analogous to the first few weeks of a heroin addiction.  We&#8217;ve all been there.  Ben Bernanke hooks you up with some killer junk for the first time.  You slide in the needle an pretty soon you&#8217;re a quivering mound of oozing pleasure.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Those were some crazy times.  Anyway, the Fed&#8217;s artificially low interest rates lead to over-borrowing.   Eventually, people borrow so much that they can&#8217;t take on any more debt so all this buying suddenly stops. Additionally, many people declare bankruptcy when they find they can&#8217;t make their payments.  According to the graph, this &#8220;Bust&#8221; period typically initiates when the average household debt to GDP ratio reaches 100%.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When the buying slows down, businesses don&#8217;t need so many employees anymore.  This leads to layoffs and more bankruptcies.  All this new unemployment leads to even lower consumer spending. Lower consumer spending leads to even more layoffs and bankruptcies.  Hence, the cycle just feeds on itself.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This suggests that our current crisis is about something much <strong>simpler</strong> than credit default swaps, derivatives, or toxic assets. It&#8217;s all about borrowing more than we can pay back.   This is the view of the Austrian economists who accurately predicted the impending disaster.  If the government would just let the market set the interest rate you wouldn&#8217;t have this unsustainable accumulation of debt and the inevitable resulting crash.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The only problem with that solution it that it makes sense.  Hence, it&#8217;s not really a feasible public policy option.  Naturally, the government&#8217;s solution was to do even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing" target="_blank">more </a>of what caused the problem in the first place.</p>
<p dir="ltr">President Obama reappointed Ben Bernanke, the person who&#8217;s policies helped created the initial bubble. The Federal Reserve created trillions of more dollars in new loans in order to stimulate even more borrowing and debt.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;"><em>Graph Source: <a href="https://research.stlouisfed.org/" target="_blank">http://research.stlouisfed.org/</a></em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Why would the government behave so irrationally? The reason is that the majority of people with enough expertise and money to influence the system profit from the status quo. Financial institutions like Goldman-Sachs make trillions of dollars in interest by loaning the money the Fed creates.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It works like this:</p>
<p dir="ltr">During the financial crisis, the Fed routinely made billions of dollars in &#8220;emergency&#8221; loans to big banks at near-zero interest. Many of the banks then turned around and used the money to buy Treasury bonds at higher interest rates — <strong>essentially loaning the money back to the government at an inflated rate.</strong>&#8220;People talk about how these were loans that were paid back,&#8221; says a congressional aide who has studied the transactions. &#8220;But when the state is lending money at zero percent and the banks are turning around and lending that money back to the state at three percent, <strong>how is that different from just handing rich people money?&#8221;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">To make even more money they loan it to consumers at an even higher rate in the form of mortgages, credit card loans or other forms of lending.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That is why the country&#8217;s wealth is continuously being transferred to the relatively non-productive financial sector.  The purpose of the banks is basically to facilitate the loaning of money from savers to borrowers and collect interest from the borrower.  Most of this amounts to a financial executive sitting at the top of a skyscraper moving numbers from one account to another with a computer.  Yet for this simple task many of these financial executives are paid hundreds of times more than the construction worker who built the skyscraper gets paid.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here&#8217;s a link to an excellent easy-to-understand radio program on the causes of the collapse:<br />

<h2>2013 Budget Plans</h2>
<h4>New Look! Same Great Waste!</h4>
<p>Obama&#8217;s 2013 budget is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_United_States_federal_budget">$3.80 Trillion</a>. Romney&#8217;s will be $3.79 trillion.</p>
<p>Budget Changes Specified by Candidate Romney™:</p>
<ol>
<li>Eliminate Obamacare (which is ironically very similar to Romneycare aside from the fact that Romneycare also covered abortions) &#8211; Estimated Savings = <a href="http://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=http://www.forbes.com/sites/aroy/2012/07/27/cbo-obamacare-will-spend-more-tax-more-and-reduce-the-deficit-less-than-we-previously-thought/&amp;refURL=https://thinkbynumbers.org&amp;referrer=https://thinkbynumbers.org">$122</a> billion annually</li>
<li>Increase Military Spending &#8211; Estimated Cost = <a href="https://myaccount.nytimes.com/auth/login?URI=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2011%2F11%2F07%2Fworld%2Fpanetta-weighs-military-cuts-once-thought-out-of-bounds.html%3F_r%3D5&amp;REFUSE_COOKIE_ERROR=SHOW_ERROR">$45</a> billion annually</li>
<li>Increase Medicare Spending &#8211; Estimated Cost = <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2012/08/a-campaign-full-of-mediscare/">$71</a> billion annually</li>
<li>&#8220;Deep Reductions&#8221; in funding for the National Endowment for the Arts &#8211; Estimated Savings = <a href="https://www.philanthropy.com/article/Arts-Spending-Cut-as-2012/195421">$0.15</a> billion annually</li>
<li>Eliminate Amtrak Subsidies &#8211; Estimated Savings = <a href="http://reason.com/archives/2011/11/09/absolutely-profligate">$1.6</a> billion annually</li>
<li>Eliminate Title X Family Planning Programs &#8211; Estimated Savings = <a href="http://khn.org/news/planned-parenthood-title-10/">$0.3</a> billion annually</li>
</ol>
<p>Add it up.  Romney&#8217;s Total Savings = $0.01 trillion less than Obama&#8217;s budget! With a national debt on the order of <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/debt/current">$16.2</a> trillion, you’ll barely even notice the difference!</p>
<h2>Past Spending Records</h2>
<h5>Are you tired of all that money cluttering up your home?  Try NEW PRESIDENT™!</h5>
<p>Governor Romney™ has been scientifically proven to increase spending faster than the President Obama™! Obama has only increased government spending a disappointing <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/the-facts-about-the-growth-of-spending-under-obama/2012/05/24/gJQAIJh6nU_blog.html">5.5%</a> annually over his term.</p>
<p>Under Governor Romney, Massachusetts state spending went from $22.3 billion to $28.1 billion,  an amazing <a href="https://myaccount.nytimes.com/auth/login?URI=http%3A%2F%2Fthecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com%2F2007%2F12%2F31%2Fclarification-on-huckabee-and-romney-spending%2F%3F_r%3D5&amp;REFUSE_COOKIE_ERROR=SHOW_ERROR">6.5%</a> per year! That’s faster than most other leading governors (6.2%)! And if we&#8217;ve learned anything from the vast disparity between George W. Bush’s fiscal rhetoric and <a href="https://www.mercatus.org/publication/spending-under-president-george-w-bush">fiscal record</a>, it’s that Romney’s gubernatorial record might be a better indicator of what we could expect from a Romney federal budget.</p>

<p>Empty houses in the US = <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/economy/housing/2009-02-12-vacancy12_N.htm">14 million</a>.</p>
<p>Median Home Price = <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/ConsumerNews/save-big-buy-foreclosed-house/story?id=13052724">$160,000</a>.</p>
<p>Money Wasted on Building Unneeded Homes = <a href="http://www.rd.com/money/the-government-is-wasting-your-tax-dollars/">$2 trillion</a>.</p>
<p>Why would Americans be so dumb as to build 14 million houses they didn&#8217;t need?  The two primary reasons we built too many houses are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <strong>United States spends more than $100 billion annually to subsidize homeownership</strong>.  The mortgage market is expanded through the government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Homeowners get a big deduction on federal income taxes for mortgage interest payments and for state and local property taxes and they even get favored treatment on capital gains from the sales of primary residences.</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Fed kept interest rates artificially too low for too long</strong> instead of using the natural market interest rate.  The government was keeping interest rates low because it was stimulating a short-term economic boom (excessive housing construction).  Politicians care primarily about short-term economic performance because the crash that happens in 5 years isn&#8217;t going to keep them from getting re-elected.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If the government did not engage in these acts of market manipulation, the boom would not have occurred and the crash would not have occurred.</p>
<p>Following 9/11 the Federal Reserve reacted to keep the stock market from continuing its decent and the economy from slipping into a recession. They began to lower interest rates to increase borrowing, producing short-term economic growth.</p>
<p>These artificially low-interest rates made it much cheaper to get a mortgage. The cheaper something is, the more people buy of it. Hence, lots of people stopped renting and got mortgages. The heightened demand for mortgages intrinsically meant a higher demand for houses. Since the demand for houses had increased the sellers were able to increase the price correspondingly. When investors saw house prices going up and up, they speculated that they could rely on that trend to continue. So, many investors bought houses with the plan of selling them at a later date when they were worth more money. The new demand for housing from speculators drove prices up even further which drew in more speculators. Rinse and repeat.</p>
<p>Is free market capitalism the culprit? That would be a reasonable theory if we&#8217;d had anything close to a free market within 100 years.  In a free market, prices are determined solely by supply and demand.  Prices act as signals telling an economy how to allocate its limited resources to most efficiently satisfy the desires of the people. When population increases, demand for houses increases. This results in the cost of a house to increase. This is a signal to investors that they should direct their capital at housing production and a signal to workers to go into the construction field. Hence, the function of prices in coordinating societal behaviour is pretty damn important.</p>
<p>However, in America, the Federal Reserve has the ability to alter the price of borrowing money so that the wrong signals get sent to workers and investors. Our current economic situation is the merely the consequence of this malinvestment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">This <a href="https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/SR/SR421.pdf">study</a> by the Federal Reserve examines the effects of government intervention and the absence thereof in two similar financial crises which occurred simultaneously in Chile and Mexico. Chile liquidated the insolvent banks and instituted a new regulatory system to prevent future abuses. Mexico nationalized the entire banking system keeping the insolvent banks on life support at the expense of the taxpayer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is what happened. Over the next 25 years, Chile&#8217;s per capita GDP grew 100% while Mexico has exhibited an impressive 0% growth rate.  This means the average Chilean is twice as rich as he was 25 years ago, whereas the average Mexican stayed just as poor as he was before.</p>

<p>The lesson is clear. If the government subsidizes bad behavior you get more of it. If the government taxes good behavior you get less of it.</p>
<p>Yet that&#8217;s exactly what were doing. We&#8217;re taxing successful, competently run businesses to subsidize irresponsible, poorly run businesses. Until we realize this simple fact, the previous trend of increased productivity and standards of living will only be a memory.</p>
