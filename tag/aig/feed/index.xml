<p>The financial sector receives more of the average paycheck than any other sector of the economy. &nbsp;Its share of the economy totals $2 trillion dollars.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;1985, the financial sector earned less than 16% of domestic corporate profits. &nbsp;Today, it&#8217;s over&nbsp;40%.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, finance and insurance accounted for only <a href="https://myaccount.nytimes.com/auth/login?URI=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2009%2F03%2F27%2Fopinion%2F27krugman.html%3F_r%3D5&amp;REFUSE_COOKIE_ERROR=SHOW_ERROR">4%</a> of GDP, whereas in 2007 finance and insurance accounted for <a href="https://myaccount.nytimes.com/auth/login?URI=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2009%2F03%2F27%2Fopinion%2F27krugman.html%3F_r%3D5&amp;REFUSE_COOKIE_ERROR=SHOW_ERROR">8%</a> of GDP.</p>
<p>The purpose of the financial services industry is basically to transfer money from savers to entrepreneurs. It primarily consists of using a computer to shift money from one bank account to another. This service requires virtually no physical labor and very few material resources.</p>
<p>Yet, this relatively simple service cost our country more than <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090313222046/http://www.workforce.az.gov/admin/uploadedPublications/2100_gdp.xls">$2 trillion</a> in 2007. That was more than the country spent on health care, construction, food, utilities or&nbsp;transportation.</p>

How can&nbsp;financial paper shuffling to cost us more than the construction of the skyscraper where the paper shuffling will then take place? How does this industry get us to spend such an inordinate amount of money on their services?</p>
<p>The free market system automatically optimizes resource allocation to satisfy society&#8217;s wants and needs. The current problems in our financial sector can be seen as our economy&#8217;s attempt to reduce the excessive size of the financial sector and redirect those resources to more productive purposes. Yet, the government is doing everything in its power to counteract this process. The feds have taken or committed to take over <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090505164441/http://www.bloomberg.com:80/apps/news?pid=20601087%26sid=armOzfkwtCA4%26refer=home">$12 trillion</a> from the other sectors and given them to financial institution to maintain this imbalance. This works out to <a href="http://ww4.totalnoid.com/?kwrf=https%3A%2F%2Fthinkbynumbers.org">$42,105</a> for every man, woman and child in the U.S.</p>
<p>The financial sector is at a historic high as share of the overall economy.</p>

<p>Note another year in history when it peaked, 1929. &nbsp;At that time, many of the country&#8217;s resources were shifted to this low-employee, unproductive sector. &nbsp;It was followed by a decade of unemployment and economic stagnation. &nbsp;This would suggest that it may be unwise for the government to fuel this bloating if they wish to avoid another lost decade.</p>
<p>This begs the question &#8220;Why is government taking money from the paychecks of working people and giving it to AIG and Goldman-Sachs?&#8221; They claim that their failure will result in the collapse of our entire economic system. &nbsp;This would, of course, eventually lead to a dystopian Mad Max scenario. However, the presented choice between government bailout and complete financial collapse is a false dichotomy. In reality, if the government allowed these irresponsible actors to fail, they would enter a bankruptcy process and be sold off to more smaller, more responsible companies.</p>
<p>Correlation doesn&#8217;t necessarily imply causation. However, the reason the government is so set on using tax dollars to prop up these insolvent companies (as opposed to taking the bankruptcy route) might be related to campaign contributions. For instance, AIG executives gave more than <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=7110145">$630,000</a> during the 2008 political cycle even as the company was falling apart. President Obama collected a total of <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=7110145&amp;page=1">$130,000</a> from AIG in 2008, while McCain accepted a total of <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=7110145&amp;page=1">$59,499</a>. Last year AIG and its subsidiaries spent about <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2009/03/before-the-fall-aig-payouts-we/">$9.7 million</a> on federal lobbying, or about $53,000 for every day Congress was in session in 2008. Additionally, Obama&#8217;s top presidential campaign contributor was <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/earl-ofari-hutchinson/mccain-and-obamas-wall-st_b_129872.html">Goldman-Sachs</a>. McCain&#8217;s was Merril-Lynch.</p>
<p>For all the awful investments AIG made, this political investment has produced a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/03/16/AIG.bonuses/">1730000%</a> rate of return.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To answer this question, we have to understand why was AIGFP (American International Group&#8217;s Financial Products) division in financial trouble.  To understand this, we have to know what a credit default swap is.  The answer to that is illustrated here.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">So what caused AIG to fail?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Allegations of accounting irregularities, caused AIG to be downgraded from a AAA to A credit rating. This downgrade triggered provisions in some of AIGFP&#8217;s credit default swaps which required AIG to provide <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=377&amp;Itemid=29">billions of dollars</a> in collateral to their counterparties. (Counterparties are companies like Goldman Sachs which bought credit default swaps from AIGFP to insure against mortgage defaults within their mortgage backed securities.)</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Government &#8220;Loans&#8221;</h3>
<p>Since AIG didn&#8217;t have the money to put up this collateral, the government loaned them <a href="https://myaccount.nytimes.com/auth/login?URI=http%3A%2F%2Fdealbook.blogs.nytimes.com%2F2009%2F03%2F15%2Faig-discloses-counterparties-who-received-224-billion%2F%3F_r%3D5&amp;REFUSE_COOKIE_ERROR=SHOW_ERROR">$170 billion</a>. This was called a loan but there is almost no chance that the loan will ever be repaid. This is because the AIGFP division has no intrinsic worth and the has no prospects for significant future income since the real estate bubble on which it thrived on has burst. As of 2011, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130109115424/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/18/aig-bailout_n_930867.html">$11.4 billion</a> has been repaid.</p>
<p>AIG recently released a list of their <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160328160126/http://www.aig.com/aigweb/internet/en/files/CounterpartyAttachments031809_tcm385-155645.pdf">counterparties</a> who received the bailout money. Most of this American taxpayer money went to European banks.</p>
<h3>Was the Bailout Really Necessary?</h3>
<p>On April 2nd, Hank Greenberg, former CEO of AIG,<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?285045-101/aig-collapse-federal-rescue-continuation"> testified </a>before congress that the taxpayer would have been much better off if the government had allowed AIGFP to file Chapter 11 bankruptcy. <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?285045-101/aig-collapse-federal-rescue-continuation">(Video of Testimony)</a></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/Greenberg-AIG-Bailout-Bankruptcy.mp3">Greenberg Congressional Testimony on AIG Bailout Bankruptcy Option</a></p>
<p>Through this process, AIGFP would be broken up and sold off. The proceeds would go to their creditors. If this were to occur, the counterparties would have only received maybe 20% or 30% of the money that AIG owed them, but Greenberg said it definitely would not have led to systemic failure of the entire financial system. It makes sense. For instance, Goldman Sachs received <a href="https://myaccount.nytimes.com/auth/login?URI=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2009%2F03%2F16%2Fbusiness%2F16rescue.html%3F_r%3D5&amp;REFUSE_COOKIE_ERROR=SHOW_ERROR">$12.9 billion</a> in counterparty payments. That&#8217;s far less than the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110510012015/http://www.fiercefinance.com/story/more-goldman-sachs-bonus-pool/2007-12-14">$18 billion</a> that they spent on executive bonuses in 2007. So the receipt of only $3 billion through an AIG bankruptcy settlement would not have broken them, but it would certainly have brought down executive compensation.</p>
<h3>What Was the Real Motivation?</h3>
<p>Numerous congressmen have requested the Treasury Department&#8217;s explicit explanation of how AIGFP division&#8217;s bankruptcy would destabilize our county&#8217;s entire financial system. Naturally, the Treasury has failed to provide a description of this scenario. This, in conjunction with the fact that Goldman Sachs was President Obama&#8217;s number <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/Blotter/story?id=5891663">1 campaign contributor</a>, should make anyone suspicious of our government&#8217;s motives. In fact, Goldman Sachs has spent over <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/Blotter/story?id=5891663">$43 million</a> on political contributions. This is a paltry sum when compared to the tens of billions they made off of the AIG bailout.</p>
<h3>How Much Did The Bailout Cost You?</h3>
<p>The bottom line is that the average household in America had to shell out around $2000 to make sure that AIG&#8217;s counterparties (giant financial institutions) wouldn&#8217;t have to accept the risk which they made when they allowed a private entity, AIG, to insure on their behalf with a public statement that they were able to evaluate. Losses are socialized and profits are privatized. I can guarantee that each household would not have received $2000 from AIG had these investments turned out to be successful.</p>
