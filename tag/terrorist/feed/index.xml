<p>The US spends more than $500 million per victim on anti-terrorism efforts. &nbsp;However, cancer research spending is only $10,000 per victim. &nbsp;Evolutionary psychology may offer an explanation for this irrational threat amplification.</p>
<h6>But first a message from NATIONAL REPUBLICAN campaign committee:</h6>
<p><em>Lightning.</em></p>
<p><em>Over the last decade it has stricken more Americans than terrorists have. It will stop at nothing to destroy our way of life.</em></p>
<p><em>Yet some politicians in Washington don’t see lightning as a threat.&nbsp;Barack&nbsp;Hussein Obama&nbsp;<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">doesn</span>’t. In the Senate, he voted to allocate hundreds of billions of dollars to the so-called war on terror, while spending absolutely nothing on a threat which has taken far more American lives. He just <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">doesn</span>’t get it.</em></p>
<p><em>Barack Obama.</em></p>
<p><em>Wrong on lightning.</em></p>
<p><em>Wrong for America.</em></p>
<h3>Putting Terrorism in Perspective</h3>
<p>Roughly <a href="http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/crt/2003/33777.htm">3,000 Americans</a> have lost their lives to terrorist attacks in the last decade. This averages out to a loss of 300 people a year, which is a tragic figure and, as a country, it behooves us to do everything we can to reduce or eliminate the threat of terrorism. But there are still a lot of other ways to wind up being the main course at a worm banquet. The gravest dangers we face include heart disease, cancer, and celebrity breakups. Unfortunately, our country doesn’t have infinite resources available to eliminate every threat. So the task falls to our government to allocate what resources we do have in a manner proportional to the magnitude of each threat. If we, as a society, want to effectively counter the dangers we face, we first have to put them in perspective.</p>
<h3>How You&#8217;re Really Going to Die</h3>
</div>
<p>Ranked by the number of victims, heart disease comes in as the number one threat. It’s responsible for <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr51/nvsr51_05.pdf">70</a><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr51/nvsr51_05.pdf">0,000 deaths</a>&nbsp;a year. This coronary malady keeps food on the tables of funeral directors nationwide. And, like a perpetual motion machine, this very food fills their arteries with cholesterol leading to even more heart attacks.</p>
<p>On to number two. Cancer kills <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr51/nvsr51_05.pdf">550,000 people a year</a>. But ironically, some futurists see it as a potential key to immortality. It removes the limit on the number of times that a cell can replicate itself. Thus, if properly harnessed, this disease could be used to defy aging by allowing eternal tissue regeneration. This would enable Joan Rivers to continue enchanting Americans with her iconic brand of celebrity commentary for generations to come.</p>
</div>
<p><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr51/nvsr51_05.pdf">Runners up for the best solution to overpopulation include strokes with 160,000 casualties a year, respiratory disease with 120,000 casualties annually, diabetes at 70,000 , pneumonia at 60,000 , Alzheimer’s disease at 50,000 , and vehicular accidents at 40,000.</a></p>
<p>As previously stated, averaged over the last decade which contained the worst terrorist attack in our nation’s history, terrorism still only killed about 300 people a year. Compare this to the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090410234302/http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov:80/resources/Ltg%20Safety-Facts.pdf">1000 people</a> who are struck by lightning every year. Hopefully, by putting storm clouds on the federal no-fly list we’ll be able to reduce this number in the future. But until then, based on current trends you’re three times more likely to be struck by lightning than to be killed in a terrorist attack.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Screwed Up Spending Priorities</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve compared the risks, let’s examine how the government chooses to allocate our limited resources to combat these threats. To the least likely means of death I’ve mentioned, terrorism, the federal government devotes about <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL33110.pdf">$150 billion annually</a>. On the other hand, to combat the most likely cause of death, heart disease, the government contributes only <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090115095455/http://www.nih.gov//news/fundingresearchareas.htm">$2 billion</a>. And just <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090115095455/http://www.nih.gov//news/fundingresearchareas.htm">$300 million</a>&nbsp;is devoted to research on the third most likely cause of death, strokes.</p>
<p>So looking at it another way, we spend $500 million for every death from terrorism and only $2,000 for every death resulting from strokes. That means we spend 250,000 times more per death on terrorism. I’m sure all of this is very flattering to Osama bin Laden, but this disparity might leave some stroke victims scratching their heads, assuming they’ve retained full motor control of their arms.</p>

<h3>Why is the government response so disproportionate to the threat?</h3>
<h6>EVOLUTION</h6>
<p>Evolutionary psychology may be able to explain this phenomenon. The human brain has been around for 200,000 years. &nbsp; More than 99% of that evolution has been characterized by starvation and general scarcity of resources typified the environment in which humans evolved. &nbsp;In this situation, violent acquisition of resources from other groups was often a necessary survival&nbsp;technique. Hence, human brains most hyper-vigilant and&nbsp;aggressive&nbsp;toward human threats (i.e. terrorists) were most likely to survive and propagate these&nbsp;characteristics.</p>
<p>On the other hand, throughout evolutionary history medical science was almost non-existent. &nbsp;Hence, there would be no survival value added by a tendency to focus on more likely health-related causes of death. We just weren&#8217;t designed for these times.</p>
<h6>Anxiety Fatigue</h6>
<p>One possible reason is anxiety fatigue. When an individual is subjected to a stimulus for an extended period of time, such as the aroma of a hospital room, the sound of a fan, or the endless nagging of the mother-in-law, their mind eventually just filters it out. Mortality risks such as heart disease and cancer extend farther back in time than even the existence of our current civilization. Our society now more or less accepts these unfortunate facts of life as another cost of doing business.Thus, they’re filtered out of our collective consciousness to some extent. On the other hand, consider the SARS virus scare a few years ago. Despite the absence of a single American fatality, the newness of this airborne illness allowed it to occupy headlines for weeks. Similarly, the Islamic terrorist menace is also a relatively new phenomenon to the US. Maybe threat fatigue for terrorism just hasn’t set in yet.</p>
<h6>Economic Consequences</h6>
<p>The economic consequences of terrorism would, at first thought, seem like a justification for the level of concern. There was a huge financial cost associated with the 9/11 attacks. Total related insurance claim payments are estimated at <a href="http://www.iii.org/page-not-found?attempt=yy_obj_data/binary/760752_1_0/September%252011%2520Anniversary.pdf">$32.5 billion</a>. However, there’s been no definitive proof that the attacks lead to a significant decline in GDP. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061105182817/http://safespaces.com/SS.Security_htm/Security_Terrorism_Cost.htm">In fact, a GDP which had been falling due to recession in the quarter prior to 9/11 actually started growing again in the quarter following 9/11.</a></p>
<p>It’s conventional wisdom that military spending is good for the economy. However, most macroeconomic models show that, in the long term, military spending diverts resources from productive uses, such as consumption and investment. This ultimately slows economic growth and reduces employment. So if one thinks they’re protecting our economy by taking trillions of dollars away from other productive uses to fight the so-called global war on terror, they should consider upgrading their abycuss to a calculator.</p>
<h6>Nuclear Bombs</h6>
<p>Another seemingly more justifiable reason for a magnified response to terrorism is the potential for a nuclear attack that could result in a far greater number of casualties than the typical terrorist attacks have to date. According to many experts on nuclear proliferation, the possibly insurmountable technical challenges of building or acquiring a thermo-nuclear weapon are enormous. <a href="http://www.iiss.org/en/about-s-us/press-s-room">Including the requirement that the weapon be portable, makes the likelihood of acquisition dramatically more remote. </a>However, there is a real threat that highly enriched uranium could be aquired from a former Soviet state and used to make a crude bomb. This is a serious risk and needs to be addressed by either securing or downgrading the 1000 tons of yellowcake remaining within Russia and her neighbors. The government currently spends about a billion dollars on this effort annually. Compare this to the two billion we spend in Iraq every week and one might assume we have a bonobo setting our national security priorities in exchange for bananas.</p>
<h6>Human Psychology</h6>
<p>Finally, the psychological makeup of our species could also be a contributing factor to this risk amplification. Just look at the plot structure of a work of fiction. The vast majority of conflicts are between a human protagonist and a human antagonist.We seem to maintain an inherent attraction to interpersonal or, on a larger scale, inter-societal conflict. It’s only natural that this affinity translates to our media diet as well. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110812194103/http://comminfo.rutgers.edu/jri/workingpapers/agendasettingsars2003.html">Many studies have shown that the media sets the public policy agenda.</a>So, the point is that interpersonal and societal conflicts like that between Western civilization and Muslim extremists are simply better able to maintain our attention than conflicts between man and complex, abstract medical threats.</p>
<p>In addition, sociologists and psychologists have determined that society amplifies the danger of risks imposed upon them, such as terrorism. Conversely, society finds risks resulting from voluntary behavior, such as car accidents, more acceptable.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>By George &#8220;Ghost F**ker&#8221; Will</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">   A plurality of Americans believe that Iran is an irrational, suicide-bound regime that would use nuclear-weapons up in this bitch, given the chance. But is this belief supported by an Iranian history of violence?  Is Iran really a bunch of stone-cold killaz or, alternatively, are these bitchez just yanking our nizzos?</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">   If Iran is truly as wicked hardcore as Americans claim, they should have a history with a serious mutha f***in&#8217; body count. However, when you examine Iran&#8217;s history, it becomes painfully obvious that Iran, in fact, has a p***y for ballz. Despite the incendiary rhetoric of its leaders, Iran, when comparing their body count to that of the United States, just be lookin&#8217; like some candy-ass bitchez.</p>
<p>Conversely, a serious examination of American historical interaction with Iran reveals the US actually possesses grenades for balls that will indeed get your mouf blowed up when you suck them.  Let&#8217;s look at the numbers.</td>

<li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_Air_Flight_655">Iran Air Flight 655</a></strong> was a civilian jet airliner shot down by U.S. missiles on July 3, 1988, over the Strait of Hormuz, toward the end of the Iran–Iraq War. The aircraft, an Airbus A300B2-203 operated by Iran Air, was flying from Bandar Abbas, Iran, to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, over Iran&#8217;s territorial waters in the Persian Gulf on its usual flight path when it was destroyed by the United States Navy guided missile cruiser USS <em>Vincennes</em> (CG-49), killing all 290 passengers and crew aboard.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. government issued notes of regret for the loss of human lives and in 1996 paid reparations to settle a suit brought in the International Court of Justice regarding the incident, however the United States never released an apology or acknowledgment of wrongdoing. In August 1988 <em><a title="Newsweek" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek">Newsweek</a></em> quoted Vice President George H. W. Bush as saying &#8220;I&#8217;ll never apologize for the United States of America. Ever. I don&#8217;t care what the facts are.&#8221;</li>

<li>October 23, 1983, Beirut, Lebanon. A truck loaded with a bomb crashed into the lobby of the U.S. Marines headquarters in Beirut, killing <a href="http://avpv.tripod.com/AmericanVictims.html" target="_blank">241 </a>soldiers and wounding 81. Some analysts believe the Islamic Republic of Iran was heavily involved and that a major factor leading it to participate in the attacks on the barracks was America&#8217;s support for <a title="Iraq" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq">Iraq</a> in the <a title="Iran-Iraq War" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran-Iraq_War">Iran-Iraq War</a> and its extending of $2.5 billion in trade credit to Iraq while halting the shipments of arms to Iran. However, in 2001, former Secretary of Defense at the time of the bombing, Caspar Weinberger, stated: &#8220;But we still do not have the actual knowledge of who did the bombing of the Marine barracks at the Beirut Airport, and we certainly didn&#8217;t then.&#8221;</li>

<h5>1953</h5>
<p>Under orders from President Eisenhower, the CIA organized a military coup that overthrew Iran&#8217;s democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh.  Britain, unhappy that Iran nationalized its oil industry, came up with the idea for the coup and pressed the United States to mount a joint operation to remove Mossadeqh.</td>

<h5>1953 to 1979</h5>
<p>Following the coup, the U.S installed Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi , and the thriving democracy that existed in Iran was crushed.  The Shah led 25 years of tyrannical rule (supported by the CIA) that resulted in the killing of thousands of Iranians who opposed the U.S. puppet government.  On the economic front, the Shah denationalized Iran’s oil industry, 60% of which went to American firms.</td>

<h5>1979</h5>
<p>U.S.-backed Shah of Iran forced to leave the country after widespread demonstrations and strikes. Islamic religious leader Ayatollah Khomeini returns from exile and takes effective power.  Sixty-six hostages taken by students at the U.S. embassy in Tehran.  The students justified taking the hostages as retaliation for the admission of the Shah into the U.S., and demanded the Shah be returned to Iran for a trial. The new Iranian regime believed the Shah was in the U.S. so that the U.S. could carry out another coup d&#8217;etat in Iran; the U.S. claimed he had come there only to seek medical attention. The Shah was given refuge and Iranians demanded his extradition to Iran to face justice.  The U.S. rejected Iran&#8217;s request and the hostage taking ensued. The hostage crisis at the U.S. embassy in Tehran lasted 444 days.</td>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>FACT 1: 95% of suicide terrorist attacks are targeted at occupying foreign militaries.</h3>
<h3>FACT 2: 0% of suicide terrorist attacks have been directed at countries not militarily involved in geopolitical disputes.</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Pape">Robert Pape</a> at the University of Chicago, with funding from the Department of Defense, has created the first comprehensive <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140423184416/http://cpost.uchicago.edu:80/search.php">database</a> of <strong>every</strong> suicide terrorist attack in the world from 1980 until today.  The data reveal important truths that must be realized before there can be any hope of minimizing this threat.</p>
<p>Every suicide terrorist campaign has had a clear goal that is secular and political: to compel a modern democracy to withdraw military forces from the territory that the terrorists view as their homeland.</p>
<p>From the <em><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/suicide-terrorism-by-robert-pape.pdf">The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism</a></em> by Robert Pape:</p>
<blockquote><p>As Table 1 indicates, there have been 188 separate suicide terrorist attacks between 1980 and 2001. Of these, 179, or 95%, were parts of organized, coherent campaigns, while only nine were isolated or random events. Seven separate disputes have led to suicide terrorist campaigns: the presence of American and French forces in Lebanon, Israeli occupation of West Bank and Gaza, the independence of the Tamil regions of Sri Lanka, the independence of the Kurdish region of Turkey, Russian occupation of Chechnya, Indian occupation of Kashmir, and the presence of American forces on the Saudi Arabian Peninsula. Overall, however, there have been 16 distinct campaigns, because in certain disputes the terrorists elected to suspend operations one or more times either in response to concessions or for other reasons.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Suicide-Terrorist-Campaigns.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" title="Statistics on Suicide Terrorist Campaigns" src="https://i2.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Suicide-Terrorist-Campaigns.jpg?resize=615%2C440" alt="Table of Statistics on Suicide Terrorist Campaigns (1980-2001)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p>Every suicide campaign from 1980 to 2001 has had as a major objective—or as its central objective—coercing a foreign government that has military forces in what they see as their homeland to take those forces out. Table 2 summarizes the disputes that have engendered suicide terrorist campaigns. Since 1980, there has not been a suicide terrorist campaign directed mainly against domestic opponents or against foreign opponents who did not have military forces in the terrorists homeland. Although attacks against civilians are often the most salient to Western observers, actually every suicide terrorist campaign in the past two decades has included attacks directly against the foreign military forces in the country, and most have been waged by guerrilla organizations that also use more conventional methods of attack against those forces.</p></blockquote>
<h5><a href="https://i2.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Motivation-and-Targets-of-Suicide-Terroist-Campaigns.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" title="Motivation and Targets of Suicide Terrorist Campaigns" src="https://i2.wp.com/thinkbynumbers.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Motivation-and-Targets-of-Suicide-Terroist-Campaigns.jpg?resize=638%2C241" alt="Statistics on Motivation and Targets of Suicide Terrorist Campaigns (1980-2001)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h5>
<blockquote><p>Even Al Qaeda ﬁts this pattern. Although Saudi Arabia is not under American military occupation per se and the terrorists have</p>
<p>political objectives against the Saudi regime and others, one major objective of Al Qaeda is the expulsion of U.S. troops from the Saudi Peninsula and there have been a tacks by terrorists loyal to Osama Bin Laden against American troops in Saudi Arabia. To be sure, there is a major debate among Islamists over the morality of suicide attacks, but within Saudi Arabia there is little debate over Al Qaeda’s objection to American forces in the region and over 95% of Saudi society reportedly agrees with Bin Laden on this matter (Sciolino 2002).</p></blockquote>
<p>The popularity of suicide terrorism is growing as a result of ground operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. 89 percent of all suicide terrorism around the world since the Iraq war is the direct result of troops on the ground.</p>
<p>Below is a graph I made using <a href="http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2004/10/global-us-troop-deployment-1950-2003" target="_blank">Global US Troop Deployment Data</a> and data from the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140423184416/http://cpost.uchicago.edu:80/search.php" target="_blank">Chicago Project on Security and Terrorism</a>.  The rise in US troop deployments in the middle east temporally precedes the rise in suicide terrorist attacks. This fact suggests[1. Conditions Necessary to Infer Causation (Kenny, 1979):<br />
Time precedence: For 1 to cause 2, 1 must precede 2. The cause must precede the effect. The time precedence condition is satisfied since the troop increase occurs prior to the increase in attacks.</p>
<p>Relationship: The variables must correlate. To determine the relationship of two variables, it must be determined if the relationship could occur due to chance. Lay observers are often not good judges of the presence of relationships, thus, statistical methods are used to measure and test the existence and strength of relationships. The relationship condition is obviously satisfied because the magnitude of the upward trend completely dwarfs any random variation exhibited prior to the US invasion.</p>
<p>Nonspuriousness (spuriousness- not genuine): “The third and final condition for a causal relationship is nonspuriousness (Suppes, 1970). For a relationship between X and Y to be nonspurious, there must not be a Z that causes both X and Y such that the relationship between X and Y vanishes once Z is controlled” (Kenny, 1979. pp. 4-5). that violently invading and occupying a country will increase animosity among the population that is being invaded. This animosity tends to manifest itself in the form of terrorist attacks perpetrated against the violent invader. The nonspuriousness condition can be assumed to be satisfied unless some other causal factor that better fulfills the relationship and time precedence conditions is identified.] that violently invading and occupying a country will increase animosity among the population that is being invaded. This animosity tends to manifest itself in the form of terrorist attacks perpetrated against the violent invader.<span style="text-align: center;"> </span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The desired end as defined by the Bush administration would be the elimination of terrorism. They attempted to achieve this using the means of military invasion and occupation. The above graph suggests that the means used did not achieve the desired end. In fact, the means produce the opposite of the desired ends.</p>
<h2>The Public Believes that the Government Has Effectively Reduced Terrorist Capabilities But It Doesn&#8217;t Believe that Terrorist Capabilities Have Been Reduced</h2>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2009/02/18/obama-faces-familiar-divisions-over-anti-terror-policies/">Pew polling</a>, a majority of the public (61%) believes that the ability of terrorists to launch a major attack is about the same (44%) or greater than (17%) it was at the time of the 9/11 attacks. So the public doesn&#8217;t think the hundreds of billions spent on the War on Terror are producing any reduction in capabilities.  Yet, somehow the  the majority of the public (71%) continues to say the government has done very (22%) or fairly well (49%) in reducing the threat of terrorism.  It&#8217;s hard to understand how one can think the government is doing a good job at reducing the threat of terrorism when one believes that it hasn&#8217;t been reduced.</p>

<h2>How to Reduce the Terrorist Threat</h2>
<p>The data clearly indicate that increasing the degree of US military occupation in majority-Islamic countries, will only serve to increase the threat of terrorism.  I&#8217;d never accuse the American public of being quick, but they do seem to learn over time.  Half of Americans (50%) now believe that decreasing the U.S. military presence overseas would be the more effective policy, while just 31% say an increased presence would be more effective.</p>
