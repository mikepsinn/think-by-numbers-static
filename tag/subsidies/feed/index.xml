<h2>2013 Budget Plans</h2>
<h4>New Look! Same Great Waste!</h4>
<p>Obama&#8217;s 2013 budget is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_United_States_federal_budget">$3.80 Trillion</a>. Romney&#8217;s will be $3.79 trillion.</p>
<p>Budget Changes Specified by Candidate Romney™:</p>
<ol>
<li>Eliminate Obamacare (which is ironically very similar to Romneycare aside from the fact that Romneycare also covered abortions) &#8211; Estimated Savings = <a href="http://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=http://www.forbes.com/sites/aroy/2012/07/27/cbo-obamacare-will-spend-more-tax-more-and-reduce-the-deficit-less-than-we-previously-thought/&amp;refURL=https://thinkbynumbers.org&amp;referrer=https://thinkbynumbers.org">$122</a> billion annually</li>
<li>Increase Military Spending &#8211; Estimated Cost = <a href="https://myaccount.nytimes.com/auth/login?URI=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2011%2F11%2F07%2Fworld%2Fpanetta-weighs-military-cuts-once-thought-out-of-bounds.html%3F_r%3D5&amp;REFUSE_COOKIE_ERROR=SHOW_ERROR">$45</a> billion annually</li>
<li>Increase Medicare Spending &#8211; Estimated Cost = <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2012/08/a-campaign-full-of-mediscare/">$71</a> billion annually</li>
<li>&#8220;Deep Reductions&#8221; in funding for the National Endowment for the Arts &#8211; Estimated Savings = <a href="https://www.philanthropy.com/article/Arts-Spending-Cut-as-2012/195421">$0.15</a> billion annually</li>
<li>Eliminate Amtrak Subsidies &#8211; Estimated Savings = <a href="http://reason.com/archives/2011/11/09/absolutely-profligate">$1.6</a> billion annually</li>
<li>Eliminate Title X Family Planning Programs &#8211; Estimated Savings = <a href="http://khn.org/news/planned-parenthood-title-10/">$0.3</a> billion annually</li>
</ol>
<p>Add it up.  Romney&#8217;s Total Savings = $0.01 trillion less than Obama&#8217;s budget! With a national debt on the order of <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/debt/current">$16.2</a> trillion, you’ll barely even notice the difference!</p>
<h2>Past Spending Records</h2>
<h5>Are you tired of all that money cluttering up your home?  Try NEW PRESIDENT™!</h5>
<p>Governor Romney™ has been scientifically proven to increase spending faster than the President Obama™! Obama has only increased government spending a disappointing <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/the-facts-about-the-growth-of-spending-under-obama/2012/05/24/gJQAIJh6nU_blog.html">5.5%</a> annually over his term.</p>
<p>Under Governor Romney, Massachusetts state spending went from $22.3 billion to $28.1 billion,  an amazing <a href="https://myaccount.nytimes.com/auth/login?URI=http%3A%2F%2Fthecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com%2F2007%2F12%2F31%2Fclarification-on-huckabee-and-romney-spending%2F%3F_r%3D5&amp;REFUSE_COOKIE_ERROR=SHOW_ERROR">6.5%</a> per year! That’s faster than most other leading governors (6.2%)! And if we&#8217;ve learned anything from the vast disparity between George W. Bush’s fiscal rhetoric and <a href="https://www.mercatus.org/publication/spending-under-president-george-w-bush">fiscal record</a>, it’s that Romney’s gubernatorial record might be a better indicator of what we could expect from a Romney federal budget.</p>
<h2>Campaign Contributors</h2>
<h4 dir="ltr">The Wall Street bankers that brought you President Obama™ love NEW PRESIDENT™!</h4>
<p><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.35371873271651566"><br />

<p>Empty houses in the US = <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/economy/housing/2009-02-12-vacancy12_N.htm">14 million</a>.</p>
<p>Median Home Price = <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/ConsumerNews/save-big-buy-foreclosed-house/story?id=13052724">$160,000</a>.</p>
<p>Money Wasted on Building Unneeded Homes = <a href="http://www.rd.com/money/the-government-is-wasting-your-tax-dollars/">$2 trillion</a>.</p>
<p>Why would Americans be so dumb as to build 14 million houses they didn&#8217;t need?  The two primary reasons we built too many houses are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <strong>United States spends more than $100 billion annually to subsidize homeownership</strong>.  The mortgage market is expanded through the government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Homeowners get a big deduction on federal income taxes for mortgage interest payments and for state and local property taxes and they even get favored treatment on capital gains from the sales of primary residences.</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Fed kept interest rates artificially too low for too long</strong> instead of using the natural market interest rate.  The government was keeping interest rates low because it was stimulating a short-term economic boom (excessive housing construction).  Politicians care primarily about short-term economic performance because the crash that happens in 5 years isn&#8217;t going to keep them from getting re-elected.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If the government did not engage in these acts of market manipulation, the boom would not have occurred and the crash would not have occurred.</p>
<p>Following 9/11 the Federal Reserve reacted to keep the stock market from continuing its decent and the economy from slipping into a recession. They began to lower interest rates to increase borrowing, producing short-term economic growth.</p>
<p>These artificially low-interest rates made it much cheaper to get a mortgage. The cheaper something is, the more people buy of it. Hence, lots of people stopped renting and got mortgages. The heightened demand for mortgages intrinsically meant a higher demand for houses. Since the demand for houses had increased the sellers were able to increase the price correspondingly. When investors saw house prices going up and up, they speculated that they could rely on that trend to continue. So, many investors bought houses with the plan of selling them at a later date when they were worth more money. The new demand for housing from speculators drove prices up even further which drew in more speculators. Rinse and repeat.</p>
<p>Is free market capitalism the culprit? That would be a reasonable theory if we&#8217;d had anything close to a free market within 100 years.  In a free market, prices are determined solely by supply and demand.  Prices act as signals telling an economy how to allocate its limited resources to most efficiently satisfy the desires of the people. When population increases, demand for houses increases. This results in the cost of a house to increase. This is a signal to investors that they should direct their capital at housing production and a signal to workers to go into the construction field. Hence, the function of prices in coordinating societal behaviour is pretty damn important.</p>
<p>However, in America, the Federal Reserve has the ability to alter the price of borrowing money so that the wrong signals get sent to workers and investors. Our current economic situation is the merely the consequence of this malinvestment.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;">Voters are more closely divided on the topic of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005ZH34ZQ/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B005ZH34ZQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=quant08-20" target="_blank">farm subsidies</a>. The U.S. government typically provides more than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_subsidy">$20 billion</a> a year in crop and farm subsidies, and 37% of voters feel those subsidies should continue. But a plurality (46%) thinks those subsidies should be ended, while 17% more are not sure.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;">Similarly, the federal government’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521104661/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0521104661&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=quant08-20" target="_blank">Export-Import bank</a> provides billions of dollars in loans and loan guarantees to companies like Boeing and General Electric.

Again, a plurality of 46% opposes loans and loan guarantees for this purpose. Twenty-five percent (<a href="https://www.downsizinggovernment.org/search-results?cx=006606822365722333854%3Afgcvw6tf0fw&amp;cof=FORID%3A10&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;query=voters%20don%20t%20support%20corporate%20welfare&amp;sa=Search">25%</a>) are undecided.</p>

<p>Now starving doctors will finally be able to afford an iPad thanks to your generous tax contribution! With the increased efficiency of electronic record keeping they&#8217;ll probably even be able to fire some of their fat cat administrative staff!  (It&#8217;s ironic that taxes were being taken out of the paychecks of these ~$25 per hour employees in order to provide subsidies for doctors who are <a href="http://www.globalrichlist.com/">0.2% highest income earners</a> in the world. This is compounded by the fact that the changeover will enable the doctors to save even more money by laying off administrative staff after the new technology renders them redundant.)</p>
<p>The Obama administration strongly desires that all medical records be electronic. There&#8217;s an app called Drchrono for the iPad which can make that transition happen. Logically, the government will give up to <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apple/2011/07/28/doctors-using-drchronos-ipad-app-can-now-receive-44k-from-the-government/">$44,000</a> to any doctor willing to use it.</p>
<p>The funding will come through the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act) in which the government allocated <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apple/2011/07/28/doctors-using-drchronos-ipad-app-can-now-receive-44k-from-the-government/">$19.2 billion</a> dollars to help move U.S. doctors to electronic medical record systems.  President Obama signed HITECH into law on February 17, 2009 as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), an economic stimulus bill.</p>
<p>Thank goodness we were able to raise the debt ceiling! Now the government can afford to help these destitute medical professionals climb from the impoverished depths of the <a href="http://www.globalrichlist.com/">0.2% highest income earners</a> in the world to the 0.1% highest earners.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean to imply that I oppose the adoption of electronic health records. I wholeheartedly support this goal. However, it’s important that middle class taxpayers know that they are subsidizing the top 0.2% richest Americans.</p>

<h5 dir="ltr"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.02em;">About </span><a style="letter-spacing: -0.02em;" href="https://www.downsizinggovernment.org/hud/public-housing-rental-subsidies" target="_blank">$59</a><span style="letter-spacing: -0.02em;"> billion is spent on traditional social welfare programs. </span><a style="letter-spacing: -0.02em;" href="http://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/corporate-welfare-state-how-federal-government-subsidizes-us-businesses" target="_blank">$92</a><span style="letter-spacing: -0.02em;"> billion is spent on corporate subsidies. So, the government spent nearly 50% more on corporate welfare than it did on food stamps and housing assistance in 2006.</span></h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Before we look at the details, a heartfelt plea from the Save the CEO&#8217;s Charitable Trust:</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>There’s so much suffering in the world. It can all get pretty overwhelming sometimes. Consider, for a moment the sorrow in the eyes of a CEO who’s just found out that his end-of-year bonus is only going to be a paltry $2.3 million.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>“It felt like a slap in the face. Imagine what it would feel like just before Christmas to find out that you’re going to be forced to scrape by on your standard $8.4 million compensation package alone. Imagine what is was like to have to look into my daughter’s face and tell her that I couldn’t afford to both buy her a dollar sign shaped island and hire someone to chew her food from now on, too. To put her in that situation of having to choose… She’s only a child for God’s sake.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>It doesn’t have to be this way. Thanks to federal subsidies from taxpayers like you, CEO’s like G. Allen Andreas of Archer Daniels Midland was able to take home almost <a href="http://www.aflcio.org/Corporate-Watch/Paywatch-2014">$14 million</a> in executive compensation&nbsp;last year. But he’s one of the lucky ones. There are still corporations out there that actually have to provide goods and services to their consumers in order to survive. They need your help.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><em>For just <a href="https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/tbb-0205-7.pdf">$93 billion</a> a year the federal government is able to provide a better life for these CEO’s and their families. That’s less than the cost of 240 million cups of coffee a day. Won’t you help a needy corporation today?</em></p>
<h1 dir="ltr">The Traditional Welfare Queen</h1>
<h5>Definition: social welfare</h5>
<p>n. Financial aid, such as a subsidy, provided by a government to specific individuals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When one thinks about government welfare, the first thing that comes to mind is the proverbial welfare queen sitting atop her majestic throne of government cheese issuing a royal decree to her clamoring throngs of illegitimate babies that they may shut the hell up while she tries to watch Judge Judy. However, many politically well-connected corporations are also parasitically draining their share of fiscal blood from your paycheck before you ever see it. It’s called corporate welfare. The intent here is to figure out which presents the greater burden to our federal budget, corporate or social welfare programs.</p>
<p>There are, of course, positive and negative aspects to this spending.The primary negative aspect is that you have to increase taxes to pay for it. Taxing individuals lowers their standard of living. &nbsp;It reduces people’s ability to afford necessities like medical care, education, and low mileage off-road vehicles.The common usage definition of social welfare includes welfare checks and food stamps. Welfare checks are supplied through a federal program called Temporary Aid for Needy Families. Combined federal and state <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1480174106/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1480174106&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=quant08-20" target="_blank">TANF </a>spending was about <a href="https://www.downsizinggovernment.org/hhs/welfare-spending" target="_blank">$26 </a>billion in 2006. In 2009, the federal government will spend about <a href="https://www.downsizinggovernment.org/hud/public-housing-rental-subsidies" target="_blank">$25 </a>billion on rental aid for low-income households and about <a href="https://www.downsizinggovernment.org/hud/public-housing-rental-subsidies" target="_blank">$8</a> billion on public housing projects.&nbsp;For some perspective, that’s about <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090503223422/http://www.whitehouse.gov:80/omb/budget/fy2006/tables.html">3 percent</a> of the total federal budget.</p>
<p>Note: I do not consider Medicaid to be included in the term &#8220;welfare&#8221; as it is used in common parlance. &nbsp;Typically, if one states that someone is &#8220;on welfare&#8221;, they mean that the person is receiving direct financial aid from the government. &nbsp;If we included <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1589019342/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1589019342&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=quant08-20" target="_blank">Medicaid </a>in our definition of social welfare, we would also have to consider any service that the government pays for to be &#8220;welfare&#8221;. &nbsp;For instance, public roadways to individuals&#8217; homes would also be considered &#8220;welfare&#8221; under that expansive definition.</p>
<h3>TANF (Temporary Aid to Needy Families)</h3>
<p>Another negative aspect relates to the fact that social welfare programs reduce the incentive for recipients to become productive members of society. However, in 1996, Congress passed a bill enacting limited welfare reform, replacing the<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0700608982/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0700608982&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=quant08-20" target="_blank">&nbsp;Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC)</a>&nbsp;program with the new Temporary Aid to Needy Families (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TANF" target="_blank">TANF</a>) program. Now, with the&nbsp;recent changes in healthcare including Obamacare tax implications, some states are enacting strict criteria that a family must meet to be eligible for TANF. One key aspect of this reform required recipients to engage in job searches, on the job training, community service work, or other constructive behaviors as a condition for receiving aid. The bill was signed by a man named Bill Clinton, who is much better known for an act of fellatio which, of course, had far greater societal implications. Regardless, the success of this reform was pretty dramatic.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/opre/change_time_1.pdf" target="_blank">Caseloads were cut nearly in half</a>. Once individuals were required to work or undertake constructive activities as a condition of receiving aid they left welfare rapidly. Another surprising result was a drop in the child poverty rate. Employment of single mothers increased substantially and the child poverty rate fell sharply from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.heritage.org/research/testimony/means-tested-welfare-spending-past-and-future-growth" target="_blank">20.8 percent in 1995 to 16.3 percent in 2000</a>.</p>

<h1>The Corporate Welfare Queen</h1>
<p>Now, let’s consider the other kind of welfare.</p>
<h6></h6>
<p><strong>Definition: corporate welfare</strong></p>
<p>n. Financial aid, such as a subsidy, provided by a government to corporations or other businesses.</p>
<p>The Cato Institute estimated that, in 2002, <a href="https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/tbb-0205-7.pdf">$93 billion</a> were devoted to corporate welfare. This is about <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120206093930/http://www.gpoaccess.gov:80/usbudget/fy02/browse.html">5 percent</a> of the federal budget.</p>
<h5>What is&nbsp;<strong>NOT</strong>&nbsp;considered corporate welfare?</h5>
<ol>
<li><strong>Government&nbsp;Contracts &#8211;</strong> To clarify what is and isn&#8217;t corporate welfare, a “no-bid” Iraq contract for the prestigious Halliburton, would not be considered corporate welfare because the government technically directly receives some good or service in exchange for this expenditure. Based on the Pentagon&#8217;s Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) findings of <a href="http://www.halliburtonwatch.org/reports/houston2006.pdf" target="_blank">$1.4 billion</a> of overcharging and fraud, I suppose the primary service they provide could be considered to be repeatedly violating the American taxpayer.</li>
<li><strong>Tax Breaks</strong> &#8211; Tax breaks targeted to benefit specific corporations could also be considered a form of welfare. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471711780/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0471711780&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=quant08-20" target="_blank">Tax loopholes</a> force other businesses and individual taxpayers without the same political clout to pick up the slack and sacrifice a greater share of their hard-earned money to decrease the financial burden on these corporations. However, to simplify matters, we’ve only included financial handouts to companies in our working definition of corporate welfare.</li>
</ol>
<h5>What IS considered&nbsp;corporate welfare?</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subsidies</strong> &#8211; On the other hand, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Policy_Act_of_2005">$15 billion</a> in subsidies contained in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, to the oil, gas, and coal industries, would be considered corporate welfare because no goods or services are directly returned to the government in exchange for these expenditures.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever corporate welfare is presented to voters, it always sounds like a pretty reasonable, well-intended idea. Politicians say that they’re <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0810988399/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0810988399&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=quant08-20" target="_blank">stimulating the economy</a> or helping struggling industries or creating jobs or funding important research. But when you steal money from the paychecks of working people, you hurt the economy by reducing their ability to buy the things they want or need. This decrease in demand damages other industries and puts people out of work.</p>
<p>Most of the pigs at the government trough are among the biggest companies in America, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FNSDEGQ/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00FNSDEGQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=quant08-20" target="_blank">Big 3 automakers</a></li>
<li>Boeing</li>
<li>Archer Daniels Midland</li>
<li>Enron</li>
</ul>
<h3>Farm Subsidies</h3>
<p>However, the largest fraction of corporate welfare spending, about 40%, went through the Department of Agriculture, most of it in the form of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005ZH34ZQ/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B005ZH34ZQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=quant08-20" target="_blank">farm subsidies</a>. <a href="https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa592.pdf">(Edwards, Corporate Welfare, 2003) </a> Well, that sounds OK. Someone’s got to help struggling family farms stay afloat, right? But in reality, farm subsidies actually&nbsp;tilt the cotton field in favor of the largest industrial farming operations. When it comes to deciding how to dole out the money, the agricultural subsidy system utilizes a process that is essentially the opposite of that used in the social welfare system&#8217;s welfare system. In the corporate welfare system, the more money and assets you have, the more government assistance you get. Conversely, social welfare programs are set up so that the more money and assets you have, the less government assistance you get. The result is that the absolute largest 7% of corporate farming operations receive 45% of all subsidies. <a href="https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa515.pdf">(Edwards, Downsizing the Federal Government, 2004) </a> So instead of protecting family farms, these subsidies actually enhance the ability of large industrial operations to shut them out of the market.</p>

<h3>Wal-Mart. &nbsp;Always high subsidies. &nbsp;Always.</h3>
<p>The same is true in all other industries, too. The government gives tons of favors to the largest corporations, increasing the significant advantage they already have over smaller competing businesses. If, in the court of public opinion, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1595580212/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1595580212&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=quant08-20" target="_blank">Wal-Mart</a> has been tried and convicted for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BTH4K4/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000BTH4K4&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=quant08-20" target="_blank">murder of main street</a>, mom-and-pop America, then the government could easily be found guilty as a willing accomplice. Wal-Mart receives hundreds of millions of dollars of subsidization by local governments throughout the country. These subsidies take the form of bribes by local politicians trying to convince Wal-Mart to come to their town with the dream of significant job creation. Of course, from that follows a larger tax base. For example, a distribution center in Macclenny, Florida received <a href="https://ilsr.org/walmart-distribution-centers-capture-150-million-subsidies/" target="_blank">$9 million</a> in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143038788/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0143038788&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=quant08-20" target="_blank">government subsidies</a> in the form of free land, government-funded recruitment and training of employees, targeted tax breaks, and housing subsidies for employees allowing them to be paid significantly lower wages. A study by Good Jobs First found that 244 Wal-Marts around the country had received over $1 billion in government favors.</p>
<h1>The Big Picture</h1>
<p>So now let’s look at the big picture. The final totals are <a href="https://www.downsizinggovernment.org/health-and-human-services" target="_blank">$59</a> billion, 3 percent of the total federal budget, for regular welfare and <a href="http://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/corporate-welfare-state-how-federal-government-subsidizes-us-businesses" target="_blank">$92 </a>billion, 5 percent of the total federal budget, for corporations. So, the government spends roughly 50% more on corporate welfare than it does on these particular public assistance programs.</p>
<p>Should we spend less on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/158322033X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=158322033X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=quant08-20" target="_blank">corporate welfare</a> and/or social welfare programs? Or should we spend even more? It’s up to you. A bunch of people died horrible deaths to make sure this country remained a democracy, so if you feel strongly about this issue you owe it to them to call or write your congressman and senators and give them a piece of your mind.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To answer this question, we have to understand why was AIGFP (American International Group&#8217;s Financial Products) division in financial trouble.  To understand this, we have to know what a credit default swap is.  The answer to that is illustrated here.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">So what caused AIG to fail?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Allegations of accounting irregularities, caused AIG to be downgraded from a AAA to A credit rating. This downgrade triggered provisions in some of AIGFP&#8217;s credit default swaps which required AIG to provide <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=377&amp;Itemid=29">billions of dollars</a> in collateral to their counterparties. (Counterparties are companies like Goldman Sachs which bought credit default swaps from AIGFP to insure against mortgage defaults within their mortgage backed securities.)</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Government &#8220;Loans&#8221;</h3>
<p>Since AIG didn&#8217;t have the money to put up this collateral, the government loaned them <a href="https://myaccount.nytimes.com/auth/login?URI=http%3A%2F%2Fdealbook.blogs.nytimes.com%2F2009%2F03%2F15%2Faig-discloses-counterparties-who-received-224-billion%2F%3F_r%3D5&amp;REFUSE_COOKIE_ERROR=SHOW_ERROR">$170 billion</a>. This was called a loan but there is almost no chance that the loan will ever be repaid. This is because the AIGFP division has no intrinsic worth and the has no prospects for significant future income since the real estate bubble on which it thrived on has burst. As of 2011, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130109115424/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/18/aig-bailout_n_930867.html">$11.4 billion</a> has been repaid.</p>
<p>AIG recently released a list of their <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160328160126/http://www.aig.com/aigweb/internet/en/files/CounterpartyAttachments031809_tcm385-155645.pdf">counterparties</a> who received the bailout money. Most of this American taxpayer money went to European banks.</p>
<h3>Was the Bailout Really Necessary?</h3>
<p>On April 2nd, Hank Greenberg, former CEO of AIG,<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?285045-101/aig-collapse-federal-rescue-continuation"> testified </a>before congress that the taxpayer would have been much better off if the government had allowed AIGFP to file Chapter 11 bankruptcy. <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?285045-101/aig-collapse-federal-rescue-continuation">(Video of Testimony)</a></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/Greenberg-AIG-Bailout-Bankruptcy.mp3">Greenberg Congressional Testimony on AIG Bailout Bankruptcy Option</a></p>
<p>Through this process, AIGFP would be broken up and sold off. The proceeds would go to their creditors. If this were to occur, the counterparties would have only received maybe 20% or 30% of the money that AIG owed them, but Greenberg said it definitely would not have led to systemic failure of the entire financial system. It makes sense. For instance, Goldman Sachs received <a href="https://myaccount.nytimes.com/auth/login?URI=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2009%2F03%2F16%2Fbusiness%2F16rescue.html%3F_r%3D5&amp;REFUSE_COOKIE_ERROR=SHOW_ERROR">$12.9 billion</a> in counterparty payments. That&#8217;s far less than the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110510012015/http://www.fiercefinance.com/story/more-goldman-sachs-bonus-pool/2007-12-14">$18 billion</a> that they spent on executive bonuses in 2007. So the receipt of only $3 billion through an AIG bankruptcy settlement would not have broken them, but it would certainly have brought down executive compensation.</p>
<h3>What Was the Real Motivation?</h3>
<p>Numerous congressmen have requested the Treasury Department&#8217;s explicit explanation of how AIGFP division&#8217;s bankruptcy would destabilize our county&#8217;s entire financial system. Naturally, the Treasury has failed to provide a description of this scenario. This, in conjunction with the fact that Goldman Sachs was President Obama&#8217;s number <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/Blotter/story?id=5891663">1 campaign contributor</a>, should make anyone suspicious of our government&#8217;s motives. In fact, Goldman Sachs has spent over <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/Blotter/story?id=5891663">$43 million</a> on political contributions. This is a paltry sum when compared to the tens of billions they made off of the AIG bailout.</p>
<h3>How Much Did The Bailout Cost You?</h3>
<p>The bottom line is that the average household in America had to shell out around $2000 to make sure that AIG&#8217;s counterparties (giant financial institutions) wouldn&#8217;t have to accept the risk which they made when they allowed a private entity, AIG, to insure on their behalf with a public statement that they were able to evaluate. Losses are socialized and profits are privatized. I can guarantee that each household would not have received $2000 from AIG had these investments turned out to be successful.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">This <a href="https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/SR/SR421.pdf">study</a> by the Federal Reserve examines the effects of government intervention and the absence thereof in two similar financial crises which occurred simultaneously in Chile and Mexico. Chile liquidated the insolvent banks and instituted a new regulatory system to prevent future abuses. Mexico nationalized the entire banking system keeping the insolvent banks on life support at the expense of the taxpayer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is what happened. Over the next 25 years, Chile&#8217;s per capita GDP grew 100% while Mexico has exhibited an impressive 0% growth rate.  This means the average Chilean is twice as rich as he was 25 years ago, whereas the average Mexican stayed just as poor as he was before.</p>

<p>The lesson is clear. If the government subsidizes bad behavior you get more of it. If the government taxes good behavior you get less of it.</p>
<p>Yet that&#8217;s exactly what were doing. We&#8217;re taxing successful, competently run businesses to subsidize irresponsible, poorly run businesses. Until we realize this simple fact, the previous trend of increased productivity and standards of living will only be a memory.</p>
