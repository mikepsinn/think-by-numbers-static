<p>The US spends more than $500 million per victim on anti-terrorism efforts. &nbsp;However, cancer research spending is only $10,000 per victim. &nbsp;Evolutionary psychology may offer an explanation for this irrational threat amplification.</p>
<h6>But first a message from NATIONAL REPUBLICAN campaign committee:</h6>
<p><em>Lightning.</em></p>
<p><em>Over the last decade it has stricken more Americans than terrorists have. It will stop at nothing to destroy our way of life.</em></p>
<p><em>Yet some politicians in Washington don’t see lightning as a threat.&nbsp;Barack&nbsp;Hussein Obama&nbsp;<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">doesn</span>’t. In the Senate, he voted to allocate hundreds of billions of dollars to the so-called war on terror, while spending absolutely nothing on a threat which has taken far more American lives. He just <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">doesn</span>’t get it.</em></p>
<p><em>Barack Obama.</em></p>
<p><em>Wrong on lightning.</em></p>
<p><em>Wrong for America.</em></p>
<h3>Putting Terrorism in Perspective</h3>
<p>Roughly <a href="http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/crt/2003/33777.htm">3,000 Americans</a> have lost their lives to terrorist attacks in the last decade. This averages out to a loss of 300 people a year, which is a tragic figure and, as a country, it behooves us to do everything we can to reduce or eliminate the threat of terrorism. But there are still a lot of other ways to wind up being the main course at a worm banquet. The gravest dangers we face include heart disease, cancer, and celebrity breakups. Unfortunately, our country doesn’t have infinite resources available to eliminate every threat. So the task falls to our government to allocate what resources we do have in a manner proportional to the magnitude of each threat. If we, as a society, want to effectively counter the dangers we face, we first have to put them in perspective.</p>
<h3>How You&#8217;re Really Going to Die</h3>
</div>
<p>Ranked by the number of victims, heart disease comes in as the number one threat. It’s responsible for <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr51/nvsr51_05.pdf">70</a><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr51/nvsr51_05.pdf">0,000 deaths</a>&nbsp;a year. This coronary malady keeps food on the tables of funeral directors nationwide. And, like a perpetual motion machine, this very food fills their arteries with cholesterol leading to even more heart attacks.</p>
<p>On to number two. Cancer kills <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr51/nvsr51_05.pdf">550,000 people a year</a>. But ironically, some futurists see it as a potential key to immortality. It removes the limit on the number of times that a cell can replicate itself. Thus, if properly harnessed, this disease could be used to defy aging by allowing eternal tissue regeneration. This would enable Joan Rivers to continue enchanting Americans with her iconic brand of celebrity commentary for generations to come.</p>
</div>
<p><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr51/nvsr51_05.pdf">Runners up for the best solution to overpopulation include strokes with 160,000 casualties a year, respiratory disease with 120,000 casualties annually, diabetes at 70,000 , pneumonia at 60,000 , Alzheimer’s disease at 50,000 , and vehicular accidents at 40,000.</a></p>
<p>As previously stated, averaged over the last decade which contained the worst terrorist attack in our nation’s history, terrorism still only killed about 300 people a year. Compare this to the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090410234302/http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov:80/resources/Ltg%20Safety-Facts.pdf">1000 people</a> who are struck by lightning every year. Hopefully, by putting storm clouds on the federal no-fly list we’ll be able to reduce this number in the future. But until then, based on current trends you’re three times more likely to be struck by lightning than to be killed in a terrorist attack.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Screwed Up Spending Priorities</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve compared the risks, let’s examine how the government chooses to allocate our limited resources to combat these threats. To the least likely means of death I’ve mentioned, terrorism, the federal government devotes about <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL33110.pdf">$150 billion annually</a>. On the other hand, to combat the most likely cause of death, heart disease, the government contributes only <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090115095455/http://www.nih.gov//news/fundingresearchareas.htm">$2 billion</a>. And just <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090115095455/http://www.nih.gov//news/fundingresearchareas.htm">$300 million</a>&nbsp;is devoted to research on the third most likely cause of death, strokes.</p>
<p>So looking at it another way, we spend $500 million for every death from terrorism and only $2,000 for every death resulting from strokes. That means we spend 250,000 times more per death on terrorism. I’m sure all of this is very flattering to Osama bin Laden, but this disparity might leave some stroke victims scratching their heads, assuming they’ve retained full motor control of their arms.</p>

<h3>Why is the government response so disproportionate to the threat?</h3>
<h6>EVOLUTION</h6>
<p>Evolutionary psychology may be able to explain this phenomenon. The human brain has been around for 200,000 years. &nbsp; More than 99% of that evolution has been characterized by starvation and general scarcity of resources typified the environment in which humans evolved. &nbsp;In this situation, violent acquisition of resources from other groups was often a necessary survival&nbsp;technique. Hence, human brains most hyper-vigilant and&nbsp;aggressive&nbsp;toward human threats (i.e. terrorists) were most likely to survive and propagate these&nbsp;characteristics.</p>
<p>On the other hand, throughout evolutionary history medical science was almost non-existent. &nbsp;Hence, there would be no survival value added by a tendency to focus on more likely health-related causes of death. We just weren&#8217;t designed for these times.</p>
<h6>Anxiety Fatigue</h6>
<p>One possible reason is anxiety fatigue. When an individual is subjected to a stimulus for an extended period of time, such as the aroma of a hospital room, the sound of a fan, or the endless nagging of the mother-in-law, their mind eventually just filters it out. Mortality risks such as heart disease and cancer extend farther back in time than even the existence of our current civilization. Our society now more or less accepts these unfortunate facts of life as another cost of doing business.Thus, they’re filtered out of our collective consciousness to some extent. On the other hand, consider the SARS virus scare a few years ago. Despite the absence of a single American fatality, the newness of this airborne illness allowed it to occupy headlines for weeks. Similarly, the Islamic terrorist menace is also a relatively new phenomenon to the US. Maybe threat fatigue for terrorism just hasn’t set in yet.</p>
<h6>Economic Consequences</h6>
<p>The economic consequences of terrorism would, at first thought, seem like a justification for the level of concern. There was a huge financial cost associated with the 9/11 attacks. Total related insurance claim payments are estimated at <a href="http://www.iii.org/page-not-found?attempt=yy_obj_data/binary/760752_1_0/September%252011%2520Anniversary.pdf">$32.5 billion</a>. However, there’s been no definitive proof that the attacks lead to a significant decline in GDP. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061105182817/http://safespaces.com/SS.Security_htm/Security_Terrorism_Cost.htm">In fact, a GDP which had been falling due to recession in the quarter prior to 9/11 actually started growing again in the quarter following 9/11.</a></p>
<p>It’s conventional wisdom that military spending is good for the economy. However, most macroeconomic models show that, in the long term, military spending diverts resources from productive uses, such as consumption and investment. This ultimately slows economic growth and reduces employment. So if one thinks they’re protecting our economy by taking trillions of dollars away from other productive uses to fight the so-called global war on terror, they should consider upgrading their abycuss to a calculator.</p>
<h6>Nuclear Bombs</h6>
<p>Another seemingly more justifiable reason for a magnified response to terrorism is the potential for a nuclear attack that could result in a far greater number of casualties than the typical terrorist attacks have to date. According to many experts on nuclear proliferation, the possibly insurmountable technical challenges of building or acquiring a thermo-nuclear weapon are enormous. <a href="http://www.iiss.org/en/about-s-us/press-s-room">Including the requirement that the weapon be portable, makes the likelihood of acquisition dramatically more remote. </a>However, there is a real threat that highly enriched uranium could be aquired from a former Soviet state and used to make a crude bomb. This is a serious risk and needs to be addressed by either securing or downgrading the 1000 tons of yellowcake remaining within Russia and her neighbors. The government currently spends about a billion dollars on this effort annually. Compare this to the two billion we spend in Iraq every week and one might assume we have a bonobo setting our national security priorities in exchange for bananas.</p>
<h6>Human Psychology</h6>
<p>Finally, the psychological makeup of our species could also be a contributing factor to this risk amplification. Just look at the plot structure of a work of fiction. The vast majority of conflicts are between a human protagonist and a human antagonist.We seem to maintain an inherent attraction to interpersonal or, on a larger scale, inter-societal conflict. It’s only natural that this affinity translates to our media diet as well. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110812194103/http://comminfo.rutgers.edu/jri/workingpapers/agendasettingsars2003.html">Many studies have shown that the media sets the public policy agenda.</a>So, the point is that interpersonal and societal conflicts like that between Western civilization and Muslim extremists are simply better able to maintain our attention than conflicts between man and complex, abstract medical threats.</p>
<p>In addition, sociologists and psychologists have determined that society amplifies the danger of risks imposed upon them, such as terrorism. Conversely, society finds risks resulting from voluntary behavior, such as car accidents, more acceptable.</p>

<h2>2013 Budget Plans</h2>
<h4>New Look! Same Great Waste!</h4>
<p>Obama&#8217;s 2013 budget is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_United_States_federal_budget">$3.80 Trillion</a>. Romney&#8217;s will be $3.79 trillion.</p>
<p>Budget Changes Specified by Candidate Romney™:</p>
<ol>
<li>Eliminate Obamacare (which is ironically very similar to Romneycare aside from the fact that Romneycare also covered abortions) &#8211; Estimated Savings = <a href="http://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=http://www.forbes.com/sites/aroy/2012/07/27/cbo-obamacare-will-spend-more-tax-more-and-reduce-the-deficit-less-than-we-previously-thought/&amp;refURL=https://thinkbynumbers.org&amp;referrer=https://thinkbynumbers.org">$122</a> billion annually</li>
<li>Increase Military Spending &#8211; Estimated Cost = <a href="https://myaccount.nytimes.com/auth/login?URI=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2011%2F11%2F07%2Fworld%2Fpanetta-weighs-military-cuts-once-thought-out-of-bounds.html%3F_r%3D5&amp;REFUSE_COOKIE_ERROR=SHOW_ERROR">$45</a> billion annually</li>
<li>Increase Medicare Spending &#8211; Estimated Cost = <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2012/08/a-campaign-full-of-mediscare/">$71</a> billion annually</li>
<li>&#8220;Deep Reductions&#8221; in funding for the National Endowment for the Arts &#8211; Estimated Savings = <a href="https://www.philanthropy.com/article/Arts-Spending-Cut-as-2012/195421">$0.15</a> billion annually</li>
<li>Eliminate Amtrak Subsidies &#8211; Estimated Savings = <a href="http://reason.com/archives/2011/11/09/absolutely-profligate">$1.6</a> billion annually</li>
<li>Eliminate Title X Family Planning Programs &#8211; Estimated Savings = <a href="http://khn.org/news/planned-parenthood-title-10/">$0.3</a> billion annually</li>
</ol>
<p>Add it up.  Romney&#8217;s Total Savings = $0.01 trillion less than Obama&#8217;s budget! With a national debt on the order of <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/debt/current">$16.2</a> trillion, you’ll barely even notice the difference!</p>
<h2>Past Spending Records</h2>
<h5>Are you tired of all that money cluttering up your home?  Try NEW PRESIDENT™!</h5>
<p>Governor Romney™ has been scientifically proven to increase spending faster than the President Obama™! Obama has only increased government spending a disappointing <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/the-facts-about-the-growth-of-spending-under-obama/2012/05/24/gJQAIJh6nU_blog.html">5.5%</a> annually over his term.</p>
<p>Under Governor Romney, Massachusetts state spending went from $22.3 billion to $28.1 billion,  an amazing <a href="https://myaccount.nytimes.com/auth/login?URI=http%3A%2F%2Fthecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com%2F2007%2F12%2F31%2Fclarification-on-huckabee-and-romney-spending%2F%3F_r%3D5&amp;REFUSE_COOKIE_ERROR=SHOW_ERROR">6.5%</a> per year! That’s faster than most other leading governors (6.2%)! And if we&#8217;ve learned anything from the vast disparity between George W. Bush’s fiscal rhetoric and <a href="https://www.mercatus.org/publication/spending-under-president-george-w-bush">fiscal record</a>, it’s that Romney’s gubernatorial record might be a better indicator of what we could expect from a Romney federal budget.</p>
<h2>Campaign Contributors</h2>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">GOP Candidate Ron Paul has produced a detailed budget containing over <a href="http://www.campaignforliberty.org/the-issues/ron-paul-plan-to-restore-america/">$1 trillion</a> in first-year reductions. Mitt Romney,&nbsp;Rick Santorum, and Newt Gingrich have only indicated that they would attempt to repeal Obamacare saving an average of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act#Effect_on_national_spending">$20 billion</a> a year.</p>
<h2>Why Do the Candidates&#8217; Budget Plans Matter?</h2>
<p>The only way that a president can&nbsp;noticeably&nbsp;affect the everyday lives of <em>all</em> Americans is by raising or lowing their standard of living. &nbsp;This is accomplished through their influence over the&nbsp;<em>real</em>&nbsp;tax rate. &nbsp;The <em>real</em>&nbsp;tax rate encompasses all normal forms of taxation, but it also includes a hidden tax known as&nbsp;<em>inflation</em>.</p>
<p><em>All</em> of the Republican candidates have detailed plans for modifying the tax code. &nbsp;But saying you&#8217;re going to cut taxes without cutting spending correspondingly is sneaky.&nbsp;If you cut taxes, but maintain the same level of spending, then you have to either borrow or print the resulting budget shortfall. &nbsp;Borrowing the money is <em>worse</em> than paying with taxes immediately, not only because we&#8217;ll have to pay it back in a future when the government&#8217;s fiscal situation is predicted to be far worse than is today, but we&#8217;ll&nbsp;<em>also</em> have to pay a bunch of interest on top of that.</p>
<p>The alternative to <em>borrowing</em> is to have the Federal Reserve fire up the printing press. &nbsp;The FED creates trillions of new dollars out of thin air and give it to the government through the purchase of treasury bonds. &nbsp;The effect of this is identical to the effect of criminal counterfeiting. &nbsp;If one doubles the money supply without a corresponding increase in GDP, the long-term result is that everyone&#8217;s paycheck can only buy half as much.</p>
<p>So using the magical money machine to pay the bills just shifts the tax burden to an <strong>inflation tax</strong>. &nbsp;According to the Consumer Price Index, inflation is only about <a href="http://inflationdata.com/inflation/inflation_rate/currentinflation.asp">3.5%</a>. However, the real rate of inflation is currently almost&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140831034511/http://www.cnbc.com/id/42551209/Inflation_Actually_Near_10_Using_Older_Measure">10%</a>.&nbsp;The inflation tax, while largely ignored, hurts middle-class and low-income Americans the most. &nbsp;This is because inflation is flat tax which doesn&#8217;t tax the poor at a lower rate the way our progressive income tax system does. In fact, it&#8217;s somewhat regressive because the loss in value is delayed. &nbsp;When the new money is initially created, price inflation hasn&#8217;t set in yet. &nbsp;The first people who get to spend the new money are generally giant financial institutions. &nbsp;By the time it filters down the average Joe, it&#8217;s already lost a lot of it&#8217;s value.</p>
<p>So the only way a president can change the&nbsp;<em>real&nbsp;</em>tax rate is by increasing or decreasing&nbsp;government <strong>spending</strong>. &nbsp;Therefor, the only thing about a candidate that&#8217;s&nbsp;guaranteed to&nbsp;significantly impact your life is not whether they think gay people should have the right to suffer through the institution of marriage. It&#8217;s not whether or not their religion&#8217;s doctrine includes magic underwear. &nbsp;It&#8217;s not even their tax plan. It is only the candidates&#8217; positions on <strong>spending</strong>&nbsp;that is&nbsp;guaranteed&nbsp;to directly affect your everyday life by increasing or decreasing your standard of living.</p>
<h3>But does a president really have any control over spending?</h3>
<p>After all, isn&#8217;t the level of spending set by the congress? &nbsp;This is <em>generally</em> true, but the president does have a number of very powerful means of controlling the budget:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Power to Appoint the&nbsp;Chairman&nbsp;of the Federal Reserve &#8211;&nbsp;This power enables the president to choose a chairman who would refuse to monetize the debt. &nbsp;In this case, the government wouldn&#8217;t be able to print new money out of thin air. Then congress couldn’t spend any more than tax revenues or borrowing permits.</li>
<li>The Power to Veto &#8211; The president has the power to veto bills containing spending which he opposes. &nbsp;Congress would then have to override this veto with a two-thirds majority both houses.</li>
</ol>
<h1>The Candidates Compared</h1>
<p>We know that President Obama stands shoulder to shoulder with our nation&#8217;s drunken sailors on spending, but what about the potential Republican nominees?</p>

<h3>(a.k.a. Mormobot 5000)</h3>
<h2>Specific Cuts = <strong>$20 Billion</strong></h2>
<p>Romney wants to repeal Obamacare (which is very similar to Romneycare aside from the fact that Romneycare covered abortions). &nbsp;As stated before, this would save <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act#Effect_on_national_spending">$20 billion</a> a year.</p>
<p>Other than that, this is the maximum level of specificity from his&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20121014220820/http://www.mittromney.com/issues/fiscal-responsibility">programmers</a>:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Mitt Romney will bring fiscal restraint to Washington by placing a hard cap on federal spending to force our government to live within its means and put an end to deficit spending.</em></p>
<p><em>Mitt will also curb federal spending by repealing Obamacare, the federal takeover of health care that is scheduled to cost taxpayers one trillion dollars over the next ten years. He will also focus on eliminating wasteful government spending and right-sizing the federal government to save taxpayer dollars.&nbsp;00010101.&#8221;</em></p>
<h3>The Romney Record on Spending</h3>
<p>If we&#8217;ve learned anything from the vast disparity between George W. Bush&#8217;s fiscal rhetoric and <a href="https://www.mercatus.org/publication/spending-under-president-george-w-bush">fiscal record</a>, it&#8217;s that Romney&#8217;s gubernatorial&nbsp;record might be a better indicator of what we could expect from a Romney federal budget. Under Mr. Romney, state spending went from $22.3 billion to $28.1 billion, an annual increase of 6.5 percent. &nbsp;This is twice as much as the average 2.9% average statewide budget increase.</p>
<p>So, if his record is any indication, we shouldn&#8217;t expect too much from a Romney presidency in the way of cutting the federal budget.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">(a.k.a. Dr. No)</h3>
<h2>Specific Cuts = <strong>$1 Trillion</strong></h2>
<p>From his&nbsp;<a href="http://www.campaignforliberty.org/the-issues/ron-paul-plan-to-restore-america/" target="_blank">complete detailed and itemized budget</a>:</p>
<p>&lt;</p>
<p>p style=&#8221;text-align: justify;&#8221;><em>&#8220;The Plan to Restore America cuts $1 trillion in spending during the first year of Ron Paul’s presidency, eliminating five cabinet departments (Energy, HUD, Commerce, Interior, and Education).

<h3>The Paul Record on Spending</h3>
<p>Paul’s congressional record consists of a long list of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20131024012212/http://www.clubforgrowth.org/whitepapers/?subsec=137&amp;id=921">votes </a>against federal spending.</p>
<ul>
<li>Voted against the Medicare Prescription Drug Act</li>
<li>Voted nine out of nine times against raising his own pay</li>
<li>Voted against No Child Left Behind</li>
<li>Voted against the subsidy-laden 2002 Farm Bill</li>
<li>Voted against the 1998 and 2005 Highway bill, only 1 of 9 to vote against the pork-filled 2005 bill</li>
<li>Voted against the Stimulus, TARP, auto bailout, and Cash for Clunkers</li>
<li>Voted against the Iraq War</li>
</ul>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Note: I tried to write this objectively, so I seriously put a lot of effort into finding any votes by Ron Paul for significant spending increases. &nbsp;I hoped to find some to add an appearance of increased credibility to the&nbsp;piece but was&nbsp;&nbsp;unsuccessful. &nbsp;If you have any examples, please leave them in comments at the bottom.</em></div>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at how Ron Paul&#8217;s plan would affect the individual taxpayer. &nbsp;He wants to cut <a href="http://www.campaignforliberty.org/the-issues/ron-paul-plan-to-restore-america/" target="_blank">$4,000,000,000,000</a> over his 4-year term. Divide this number by <a href="https://www.irs.gov/static_assets/error/404errorPage.html" target="_blank">142,449,000</a> federal income tax filers and that comes out to an average of&nbsp;<strong>$28,080.23 in savings for each taxpayer</strong>. &nbsp;Alternatively, the $4 trillion should be divided by 307,006,550, the total US population. This would produce a 4-year savings of $13,029.04 per person.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">Newt Gingrich</strong></h1>
<p>(a.k.a. Sorry, There&#8217;s Nothing Funny About Newt Gingrich)</p>
<p>Specific Cuts =&nbsp;<strong style="font-size: 25px; line-height: normal;">$20 Billion</strong></p>
<p>Like Cain and Romney, all his cuts would come from the repeal of Obamacare.</p>
<p>Other than that, he&#8217;s not too specific. &nbsp;From his&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130125140814/http://www.newt.org/solutions/jobs-economy/">website</a>:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Balance the budget&nbsp;by growing the economy, controlling spending, implementing money saving reforms, and replacing destructive policies and regulatory agencies with new approaches.&#8221;</em></p>
<h3>The Gingrich Record on Spending</h3>
<p>Gingrich&#8217;s fiscal record is mixed. During his time in Congress, he had an exemplary voting record on a lot of the top spending proposals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Voted NO on the Chrysler bailout in 1979</li>
<li>Voted YES on the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget bill in 1985</li>
<li>Voted YES on a balanced budget amendment (as part of the “Contract for America” effort that he led) in 1995</li>
<li>Led the effort and voted YES to cut $16.4 billion from the budget in 1995.</li>
<li>Voted YES on welfare reform in 1996</li>
</ul>
<p>Gingrich has also been a vocal opponent of most of the big spending habits pushed by the White House and Congress over the past few years.&nbsp; He opposed the $787 billion stimulus proposal,&nbsp; the auto bailout,&nbsp; and Cash for Clunkers.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in 2003, when he urged “every conservative member of Congress” to support the Medicare drug benefit bill.&nbsp; He called it the “most important reorganization of our nation&#8217;s healthcare system since the original Medicare Bill of 1965.”&nbsp; The drug benefit now costs taxpayers over $60 billion a year and has almost $16&nbsp;<em>trillion</em>&nbsp;in unfunded liabilities.</p>
<p>Notably in 2008, he also backed the $700 billion Wall Street bailout.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s also attacked those who oppose omnibus spending bills. &nbsp;These bills roll thousands of programs which may not pass on their own into massive one massive all or nothing bill that is more likely pass. In 1998, he derided a group of House conservatives by calling them the “the perfectionist caucus” for opposing a 4,000-page omnibus spending bill, adding that “those of us who have grown up and matured in this process understand after the last four years that we have to work together on big issues.”</p>

<h1><strong>Herman Cain</strong></h1>
<h1>(a.k.a. Pizza Dude)</h1>
<h2>Specific Cuts =&nbsp;<strong>$20 Billion</strong></h2>
<p>Like all the other candidates, Cain wants to repeal Obamacare which would save&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act#Effect_on_national_spending">$20 billion</a>&nbsp;a year. &nbsp;But other than that,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.caintv.com/the-issues">this</a>&nbsp;is about as detailed as it gets:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Nothing should be off the table. Every federal agency, every government program and expenditure must be reviewed and revised with a&nbsp;keen eye and a red pen.&#8221;</em></p>
<h3>The Cain Record on Spending</h3>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t exist. &nbsp;With no political record, Cain needs to be way more specific for voters to make anything close to an educated decision.</p>
<p>What is known is that Cain supported TARP, the government bailout of the financial industry. He even chastised those who opposed it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Cain opposed the Democrats’ stimulus, saying, “The Obama-Reid-Pelosi cure for more national economic pain – more spending, more taxes and more socialism! That’s just more pavement for the road to perpetual debt.”</p>
<p>This sounds nice, but without significant specific spending cuts, Cain&#8217;s 9-9-9 tax plan will actually be a 9-9-9-<strong>9</strong>&nbsp;plan. &nbsp;A 9% corporate tax, a 9% sales tax, a 9% income tax, and a&nbsp;<strong>hidden 9% inflation tax</strong>.<br />

<h1><strong>Rick Perry</strong></h1>
<p>(a.k.a. The Executioner)</p>
<h2>Specific Cuts =&nbsp;<strong>$50 Billion</strong></h2>
<h2>From his&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120211075001/http://www.rickperry.org/cut-balance-and-grow-html/">rock</a>:</h2>
<p><em>&#8220;Consolidating Department of Education funding for all elementary and secondary programs, reducing it by 50 percent, and returning the rest of the money to the states would save $25 billion in the first year.&nbsp;Reducing the portfolio of investments by government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would save $26.5 billion over ten years.&#8221;</em></p>
<h3>The Perry Record on Spending</h3>
<p>Like Romney, Perry&#8217;s real&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cato.org/blog/rick-perrys-spending-record">record&nbsp;</a>is not one of fiscal restraint.&nbsp;Rick Perry came into office in December 2000. Texas general spending has risen from $29 billion that first Perry year to $41 billion by fiscal year 2011, which works out to an average annual increase of 3.5 percent. (Data from NASBO).</p>
<p>For some perspective, let&#8217;s look at Perry versus the average spending increases of governors in all 50 states over the last decade.</p>
<p>Here is NASBO data showing increases in state general fund spending between fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2011:</p>
<ul>
<li>Texas, Perry: $29 billion to $41 billion, a 41 percent increase.</li>
<li>Total of 50 states: $506 billion to $651 billion, a 29 percent increase.</li>
</ul>
<div>Under Perry, the Texas budget increased 41% from</div>
<p>However, the Texas population has grown faster than the U.S. population, so let’s put these figures on a per-capita basis.</p>
<ul>
<li>Texas, Perry: $1,360 per capita to $1,598 per capita, an 18 percent increase.</li>
<li>Total of 50 states: $1,774 per capita to $2,091 per capita, an 18 percent increase.</li>
</ul>
<p>Perry&nbsp;is touting the &#8220;Texas Miracle&#8221; as a template for the rest of America, which is stuck in a rut of high&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130420170633/http://www.usnews.com/topics/subject/unemployment">unemployment</a>&nbsp;and could certainly use some fresh ideas for how to create jobs. Texas has clearly fared better than most other states since the recession began at the end of 2007. Its unemployment rate is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=z1ebjpgk2654c1_&amp;met_y=unemployment_rate&amp;idim=state:ST480000&amp;fdim_y=seasonality:S&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=texas+unemployment+rate">8.2%</a>, a full point lower than the national average. The housing bust in Texas was far milder than it was in other places. A strong energy sector kept state tax revenues from plunging the way they did in other states, which forestalled layoffs in state and local government. &nbsp;Additionally, the majority of the jobs created in Texas were government jobs. &nbsp;From the beginning of 2008 to the end of 2010, government employment in Texas increased by&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150416103545/http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/rick-newman/2011/08/16/how-rick-perry-created-jobs-in-texas">7 percent</a>, whereas it only increased 2 percent over the rest of the country. &nbsp;Private sector jobs in Texas only grew by 0.6% during this period.</p>
<p>So Perry&#8217;s record is perfectly&nbsp;mediocre. Like with Romney, we shouldn&#8217;t expect too much in the way of cuts&nbsp;if past is&nbsp;prologue.</p>
<h3>The Verdict</h3>
<p>So after examining the records and proposals of all the candidates, it appears that Ron Paul is the only candidate who intends to make balancing the federal budget a real priority. &nbsp; Based on the others&#8217; records and proposals, it appears pretty likely that, under their administrations, we&#8217;re going to continue the status quo Washington spending spree.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bernie Sanders &#8211; U.S. Senator for Vermont</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, Oct. 20 &#8211; Hundreds of defense contractors that defrauded the U.S. military received more than $1.1 trillion in Pentagon contracts during the past decade, according to a Department of Defense report prepared for Sen. Bernie Sanders.</p>
<p>Sanders (I-Vt.) called the report &#8220;shocking.&#8221; He said aggressive steps must be taken to ensure taxpayer dollars aren&#8217;t wasted.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ugly truth is that virtually all of the major defense contractors in this country for years have been engaged in systemic fraudulent behavior, while receiving hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer money,&#8221; said Sanders. &#8220;With the country running a nearly $15 trillion national debt, my goal is to provide as much transparency as possible about what is happening with taxpayer money.&#8221;</p>
<p>The report detailed how the Pentagon paid $573.7 billion during the past 10 years to more than 300 contractors involved in civil fraud cases that resulted in judgments of more than $1 million, $398 billion of which was awarded after settlement or judgment for fraud.  When awards to &#8220;parent&#8221; companies are counted, the Pentagon paid more than $1.1 trillion during the past 10 years just to the 37 top companies engaged in fraud.</p>
<p>Another $255 million went to 54 contractors convicted of hard-core criminal fraud in the same period. Of that total, $33 million was paid to companies after they were convicted of crimes.</p>
<p>Some of the nation&#8217;s biggest defense contractors were involved.</p>
<p>For example, Lockheed Martin in 2008 paid $10.5 million to settle charges that it defrauded the government by submitting false invoices on a multi-billion dollar contract connected to the Titan IV space launch vehicle program.  That didn&#8217;t seem to sour the relationship between Lockheed and the Defense Department, which gave Lockheed $30.2 billion in contracts in fiscal year 2009, more than ever before.</p>
<p>In another case, Northrop Grumman paid $62 million in 2005 to settle charges that it &#8220;engaged in a fraud scheme by routinely submitting false contract proposals,&#8221; and &#8220;concealed basic problems in its handling of inventory, scrap and attrition.&#8221;  Despite the serious charges of pervasive and repeated fraud, Northrop Grumman received $12.9 billion in contracts the next year, 16 percent more than the year before.</p>
<p>A Sanders provision in a defense spending bill required the report and directed the Department of Defense to recommend ways to punish fraudulent contractors. The Pentagon said sanctions already are in place. &#8220;It is not clear, however, that these remedies are sufficient &#8230; to deter and punish fraud when it is detected.&#8221; That tone was different than what the Pentagon said in a preliminary report last January, which declared that ‘the department believes that existing remedies with respect to contractor wrongdoing are sufficient.&#8221;</p>
<p>Said Sanders: &#8220;It is clear that DOD&#8217;s current approach is not working and we need far more vigorous enforcement to protect taxpayers from massive fraud.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under another Sanders provision in a separate law, a government-wide federal contractor fraud database was opened to the public earlier this year.  Access to the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System had been limited to federal acquisition officials and certain members of Congress.  The DOD promises to ramp up monitoring of this database to ensure its contractors&#8217; fraudulent actions are accurately and fully disclosed.</p>

<p>From medicalnewstoday.com:</p>
<p>The way some people talk, you&#8217;d think that a flat tax system &#8211; in which everyone pays at the same rate regardless of income &#8211; would make citizens feel better than more progressive taxation, where wealthier people are taxed at higher rates. Indeed, the U.S. has been diminishing progressivity of its tax structure for decades.</p>
<p>But a new study comparing 54 nations found that flattening the tax risks flattening social wellbeing as well. &#8220;The more progressive the tax policy is, the happier the citizens are,&#8221; says University of Virginia psychologist Shigehiro Oishi, summarizing the findings, which will be published in an upcoming issue of Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science. Oishi conducted the study with Ulrich Schimmack of the University of Toronto at Mississauga and Ed Diener, also at University of Illinois and the Gallup Organization.</p>
<p>The researchers analyzed the relationship between tax progressivity and personal well-being in 54 nations surveyed by the Gallup Organization in 2007 &#8211; a total of <a href="http://www.sharing.org/information-centre/reports/financing-global-sharing-economy-part-three-1-taxing-financial">59,634 </a>respondents. Well-being was expressed in people&#8217;s assessments of their overall life quality, from &#8220;worst&#8221; to &#8220;best possible life,&#8221; on a scale of 1 to 10; and in whether they enjoyed positive daily experiences (such as smiling, being treated with respect, and eating good food) or suffered negative ones, including sadness, worry, and shame. Finally, the analysis looked at the participants&#8217; satisfaction with their nation&#8217;s public goods, from schools to clean air.</p>
<p>The degree of progressivity was measured by the difference between the highest and lowest tax rates, corrected for such confounding factors as family size, social security taxes paid, and tax benefits received by individuals.</p>
<p>The results: On average, residents of the nations with the most progressive taxation evaluated their own lives as closer to &#8220;the best possible.&#8221; They also reported having more satisfying experiences and fewer discomfiting ones than respondents living in nations with less progressive taxes. That happiness, Oishi says, was &#8220;explained by a greater degree of satisfaction with the public goods, such as housing, education, and public transportation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Higher government spending per se did not yield greater happiness, in spite of the well-being that was associated with satisfaction with state-funded services. In fact, there was a slight negative correlation between government spending and average happiness.</p>
<p>&#8220;That data is kind of weird,&#8221; Oishi says. He guesses that the misalignment might indicate national differences in the efficiency with which those services are delivered or in people&#8217;s relative ability to access them. For example, the U.S. spends more on education and health care than other developed countries, &#8220;but its international standing in those areas is not so great.&#8221; Such puzzling findings may be illuminated in further research.</p>
<p>The study, like others Oishi has done looking at connections between economics and personal life, has important social implications. &#8220;If the goal of societies is to make citizens happy, tax policy matters,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Certain policies, like tax progressivity, seem to be more conducive to the happiness of the people.&#8221;</p>

<article>Both men have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/mitt-romney-tax-returns-make-him-a-personal-embodiment-of-gop-tax-policy/2012/01/24/gIQANvsoOQ_story.html">proposed to sharply cut taxes </a>but have not identified spending cuts sufficient to make up for the lost cash, the report said. By 2021, the debt would rise by about $4.5 trillion under Santorum’s policies and by about $7 trillion under Gingrich’s plan, pushing the portion of the debt held by outside investors to well over 100 percent of the overall economy, the study said.The red ink would gush a little more slowly under former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, the report said. Until this week, Romney had paired $1.35 trillion in tax cuts with $1.2 trillion in spending reductions, leaving the debt rising on a trajectory that closely tracks current policies.But that changed Wednesday, when Romney proposed to cut federal income tax rates by 20 percent more for all earners, which would slash U.S. revenue by more than $2 trillion over 10 years.Romney economic adviser Glenn Hubbard said the lost cash would be recovered by closing tax loopholes and boosting economic activity. But until the campaign offers a more specific plan, Budget Watch analysts said Romney’s entire framework would add about $2.6 trillion to the debt by 2021.Only Paul emerged as a fiscal conservative in the report. His policies would cut tax revenue by more than $5 trillion over the next decade, the report said, but the loss would be offset by more than $7 trillion in spending cuts, including deep reductions in defense and federal health programs.The report marks the first independent attempt to gauge the overall impact of policies proposed by the GOP candidates on the nation’s $15.4 trillion debt.“As we enter the thick of the campaign season, no one can ignore the debt issue,” said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which supports debt-reduction efforts in Washington. “This report is designed to inform the public on the fiscal policies put forward by each of the Republican candidates and stimulate debate on this crucial topic.”Paul campaign spokesman Gary Howard welcomed the analysis. “It’s not a surprise to us the report found that Congressman Paul’s plan is the only one that doesn’t raise the debt,” Howard said via e-mail. “The critical importance of dealing with our growing debt has been a hallmark issue of Dr. Paul’s campaign and his career.”</p>
<p>Romney spokesperson Andrea Saul declined to directly address the findings, arguing that Romney is the only candidate to lay out a realistic budget framework “that will jump-start the American economy and bring tax relief to middle-income Americans.”</p>
<p>Aides to Santorum and Gingrich did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>The report does not include an analysis of President Obama’s latest spending blueprint, which seeks to reduce borrowing by $3 trillion by 2021. Budget Watch plans to analyze Obama’s request in future reports.</p>
<p>The report does not seek to offer support to any candidate, and its authors have gone to significant lengths to give the campaigns and their developing policy ideas the benefit of the doubt. The report offers three scenarios for each candidate: A “low-debt scenario” is based on the most generous assumptions about the ability of proposals to save money or generate revenue. A “high-debt scenario” is much more stringent.</p>
<p>The numbers cited above are taken from the report’s “intermediate-debt scenario.” which “gives credit for non-specified changes to certain parts of the budget,” such as promises to reduce some forms of spending by a certain percentage, even if the candidate has yet to nail down ways of generating the cash.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">This <a href="https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/SR/SR421.pdf">study</a> by the Federal Reserve examines the effects of government intervention and the absence thereof in two similar financial crises which occurred simultaneously in Chile and Mexico. Chile liquidated the insolvent banks and instituted a new regulatory system to prevent future abuses. Mexico nationalized the entire banking system keeping the insolvent banks on life support at the expense of the taxpayer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is what happened. Over the next 25 years, Chile&#8217;s per capita GDP grew 100% while Mexico has exhibited an impressive 0% growth rate.  This means the average Chilean is twice as rich as he was 25 years ago, whereas the average Mexican stayed just as poor as he was before.</p>

<p>The lesson is clear. If the government subsidizes bad behavior you get more of it. If the government taxes good behavior you get less of it.</p>
<p>Yet that&#8217;s exactly what were doing. We&#8217;re taxing successful, competently run businesses to subsidize irresponsible, poorly run businesses. Until we realize this simple fact, the previous trend of increased productivity and standards of living will only be a memory.</p>
